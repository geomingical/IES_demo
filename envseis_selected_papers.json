    "abstract": "Alaska's coastal communities face growing landslide hazards owing to glacier retreat and extreme weather intensified by the warming climate, yet hazard monitoring remains challenging. As part of ongoing experimental monitoring in Prince William Sound, we detected three large landslides (0.5–2.3 M m3) at Surprise Inlet on 20 September 2024, within the span of an hour. These events were identified in near real‐time through seismic data and later confirmed using satellite imagery, tidal records, and infrasound. The landslides generated a modest tsunami, and a 4 cm wave was recorded by a tide gauge 18 km away, marking the first recorded landslide to reach water since monitoring began in this region in 2021. Here, we examine the detection and interpretation of these landslides using multiple data sources and modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this regional seismic monitoring system and show how complementary instrumentation, where available, can enhance detection capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Most public seismic recordings, sampled at hundreds of Hz, tend to be unlabelled, i.e., not catalogued, mainly because of the sheer volume of samples and the amount of time needed by experts to confidently label detected events. This is especially challenging for very low signal-to-noise ratio microseismic events that characterise landslides during rock and soil mass displacement. Whilst numerous supervised machine learning models have been proposed to classify landslide events, they rely on a large amount of labelled datasets. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop tools to effectively automate the data-labelling process from a small set of labelled samples. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised method for labelling of signals recorded by seismometers that can reduce the time and expertise needed to create fully annotated datasets. The proposed Siamese network approach learns best class-exemplar anchors, leveraging learned similarity between these anchor embeddings and unlabelled signals. Classification is performed via soft-labelling and thresholding instead of hard class boundaries. Furthermore, network output explainability is used to explain misclassifications and we demonstrate the effect of anchors on performance, via ablation studies. The proposed approach classifies four landslide classes, namely earthquakes, micro-quakes, rockfall and anthropogenic noise, demonstrating good agreement with manually detected events while requiring few training data to be effective, hence reducing the time needed for labelling and updating models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Submarine melting is one of the major mechanisms of ice loss from marine-terminating glaciers and ice shelves, but its contribution is yet to be fully understood. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring melting using passive underwater acoustics, by sensing the loud crackling sound produced during melting due to the release of pressurised ice-trapped bubbles. We profile the acoustic field in glacial bays in Svalbard using a hydrophone array and show that the sound level in the bay contains clues on the melt activity. The sound level’s interpretation is hindered by its spatial variability, which we suppress using a model of melt-induced acoustic activity. Thereby, we show that the sound generated at the glacier terminus is correlated with the ablation rate at the calving glacier front and the water temperature and thus linked to the melt rate. This marks a step forward in using passive acoustics to monitor submarine melt, paving the way for an autonomous, long-term, large-scale monitoring tool providing data that can inform assessments and simulations of ice sheet loss and sea level rise.",

    "abstract": "This study demonstrates that machine learning from seismograms, obtained from commonly deployed seismometers, can identify the early stages of slope failure in the field. Landslide hazards negatively impact the economy and public through disruption, damage of infrastructure and even loss of life. Triggering factors leading to landslides are broadly understood, typically associated with rainfall, geological conditions and steep topography. However, early warning at slope scale of an imminent landslide is more challenging. Through semi-supervised learning for seismic event detection from continuous seismic recordings over a period of about 10 years, we demonstrate that timely landslide induced displacement prediction is possible, providing the basis for landslide early warning systems. Our proposed methodology detects and characterises seismic precursors to landslide events making use of seismic recordings near an active slow moving earth slide-flow using a semi-supervised Siamese network. This data driven methodology identifies increase in microseismicity, and the change in the frequency spectrum of that microseismicity which identify key stages prior to a failure: ‘rest’, ‘precursor’ and ‘active’. Due to the semi-supervised nature of Siamese networks, the methodology is adaptable to discovering new types of distinct events, making it an ideal solution for precursor detection at new sites.",

The 2021 Chamoli rockslide and subsequent floods in India highlighted the need for effective monitoring and early warning systems. Recent studies demonstrated the potential of seismic monitoring for detecting such events in real time. However, accurate detection and differentiation of landslide seismic signals from earthquakes, and background noise remains critical. This article discusses a novel approach based on trend changes in Power Spectral Density (PSD) for distinguishing landslide-generated waveforms. The average PSDs were computed for earthquakes of small magnitude, landslides, and noise data from landslide-prone regions globally. These average PSDs serve as a global model for identifying the landslides in continuous seismic data.

    "abstract": "Abstract Ground-based time-lapse cameras are often used to monitor glacier recession, which is primarily driven by the falling of ice from the glacier front, known as iceberg calving or, more commonly, calving events. Glaciologists can utilise these images by manually identifying calving events, a laborious task that requires the analysis of thousands of images in order to identify image pairs that represent the glacier front before, during and after calving. We present a computer vision based method to filter out images rendered unusable due to weather effects such as fog and precipitation by calculating the number of salient key-points detected in the image using the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm as an indicator of the visibility of the glacier front and discarding any image with fewer key-points than a defined threshold. We propose the use of SNN (Siamese neural network) and show that it is useful in detecting calving events since it allows to separately calculate features on two images and then merges them together in order to track differences between them thus detecting calving areas. The trained model achieved an overall accuracy of 92%, with 79% of calving events and 93% of non-calving being correctly classified on an unseen test set formed from imagery in the same time period as the training data. The model was able to generalise to new time periods (and therefore small changes in viewpoint and alignment) to some extent with an overall accuracy of 82%, with 27% of calving events and 90% of non-calving being correctly classified.",

    "abstract": "The advent of machine learning has significantly improved the accuracy of identifying mass movements through the seismic waves they generate, making it possible to implement real‐time early warning systems for debris flows. However, we lack a profound understanding of the effective seismic features and the limitations of different machine learning models. In this work, we investigate eighty seismic features and three machine learning models for single‐station‐based binary debris flow classification and multi‐station‐based warning tasks. These seismic features, derived from physical and statistical knowledge of impact sources, are grouped into five sets: Benford's law, waveform, spectra, spectrogram, and network. The machine learning models belong to two families: two ensemble models, Random Forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost); one recurrent neural network model, Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM). We analyzed feature importance from the ensemble models and found that the number and even the types of seismic features are not critical for training an effective binary classifier for debris flow. When using models designed to capture patterns in sequential data rather than focusing on information only in one given window, using the LSTM does not significantly improve the performance of binary debris flow classification task over Random Forest and XGBoost. For the multi‐station‐based debris flow warning task, the LSTM model predicts debris flow probability more consistently and provides longer warning times. Our proposed framework simplifies machine learning‐driven debris flow classification and lays the foundation for affordable seismic signal‐driven early warning using a sparse seismic network.",

    "abstract": "\n A key challenge in environmental seismology is processing seismic data to study source physics, natural and human‐induced forcings, and geological structures such as landslides, glaciers, and volcanoes. Seismic arrays with dozens of stations have expanded data set sizes, and this, combined with signal complexity and high noise levels, makes it difficult to analyze using traditional event detection and labeling methods especially for low‐energy or rare events. Clustering continuous data offer a comprehensive method for exploring the data sets and detecting all relevant events. In this study, we present a clustering workflow based on self‐supervised learning (SSL) designed to handle data sets ranging in size from thousands to millions of events. This approach enables automated clustering of continuous data from seismic arrays containing dozens of stations. When applied to the “Marie‐sur‐Tinée” landslide data set, our workflow processed 10 millions 30‐s windows and identified four main families: Potential Endogenous Landslide Seismic Events, Potential Regional Earthquakes, Potential Rainfall‐Induced Signals, and Noise. Despite the overall consistency, some noise remained in the event‐related clusters highlighting areas for further improvement in clustering methods. Nevertheless, the proposed SSL‐based clustering workflow shows great potential for an efficient exploration of seismic data sets of millions of events and could be a solution for the blind exploration of similarly large data sets.",

    "abstract": "Natural landslide dams pose severe hazards when they fail, and understanding their breach processes remain challenging because such events are rarely observed directly in the field. To address this gap, we conducted large‐scale overtopping experiments with compacted (CP) and non‐compacted (NCP) dams, supported by a synchronized multi‐sensor framework that combined UAV and ground‐based photogrammetry, particle tracking velocimetry, water level gauges, autonomous scouring particles, and seismic monitoring. In situ density tests confirmed that CP dams had higher dry bulk volumetric weight and lower water content (2.33 t/m3, 4.9%) than NCP dams (2.04–1.98 t/m3, 6.8%–4.4%), corresponding to compaction levels of ∼104% for CP and 88%–89% for NCP. The multi‐sensor observations captured both surface and subsurface processes throughout failure, revealing that CP dams breached rapidly with sharp peak discharges and narrow, deeply incised channels, whereas NCP dams breached more gradually, producing flatter hydrographs and wider, shallower channels. Despite these differences, the underwater cross‐sections consistently evolved toward parabolic geometries. In addition, several characteristic signatures were observed across data sets, including concentrated velocity jets in CP versus dispersed flows in NCP, and V‐shaped seismic spectrograms observed during the processes of incision and widening. Because these experiments are approximately five times larger than typical laboratory flume studies, they captured scale‐dependent behaviors not observable in smaller facilities, including slower incision rates, later peak discharges, and more gradual hydrograph development at larger scale. These findings clarify how compaction and scale jointly influence breach timing and erosion pathways and provide physically grounded constraints for improving numerical breach models and hazard assessments.",
    "summary": "This study investigates dam failure processes, which are difficult to observe directly in natural settings. Large-scale dam breach experiments were conducted using compacted and non-compacted dams with synchronized multi-sensor monitoring. The experiments revealed differences in breach characteristics related to dam compaction, such as breach timing and channel geometry. These findings may help improve numerical models and hazard assessments of dam failures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Periglacial debris flows in alpine mountains are influenced by strong earthquakes or climatic warming and play a crucial role in delivering sediment from hillslopes and downslope channels into rivers. Rapid and massive sediment supply to rivers by the debris flows has profoundly influenced the evolution of the alpine landscape. Nonetheless, there is a dearth of knowledge concerning the roles tectonic and climatic factors played in the intensified sediment erosion and transport. In order to increase our awareness of the mass wasting processes and glacier changes, five debris flows that occurred at the Zelunglung catchment of the eastern Himalayan syntaxis since the 1950 Assam earthquake were investigated in detail by field surveys and long-term remote sensing interpretation. Long-term seismic and meteorological data indicate that the four events of 1950–1984 were the legacies of the earthquake, and recent warming events drove the 2020 event. The transported sediment volume indexed with a non-vegetated area on the alluvial fan has reduced by 91 % to a stable low level nearly 40 years after 1950. It is reasonable to hypothesize that tectonic and climatic factors alternately drive the sediment supplies caused by the debris flows. High concentrations of coarse grains, intense erosion, and extreme impact force of the 2020 debris flow raised concerns about the impacts of such excess sediment inputs on the downstream river evolution and infrastructure safety. In regard to the hydrometeorological conditions of the main river, the time to evacuate the transported coarse sediments is approximately 2 orders of magnitude longer than the recurrence period of periglacial debris flows.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is increasingly predisposing polar regions to large landslides. Tsunamigenic landslides have occurred recently in Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat), but none have been reported from the eastern fjords. In September 2023, we detected the start of a 9-day-long, global 10.88-millihertz (92-second) monochromatic very-long-period (VLP) seismic signal, originating from East Greenland. In this study, we demonstrate how this event started with a glacial thinning–induced rock-ice avalanche of 25 × 106 cubic meters plunging into Dickson Fjord, triggering a 200-meter-high tsunami. Simulations show that the tsunami stabilized into a 7-meter-high long-duration seiche with a frequency (11.45 millihertz) and slow amplitude decay that were nearly identical to the seismic signal. An oscillating, fjord-transverse single force with a maximum amplitude of 5 × 1011 newtons reproduced the seismic amplitudes and their radiation pattern relative to the fjord, demonstrating how a seiche directly caused the 9-day-long seismic signal. Our findings highlight how climate change is causing cascading, hazardous feedbacks between the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. Editor’s summary A large rockslide occurred in Greenland on 16 September 2023 that generated a local tsunami. The event was energetic enough to generate a global signal that resonated for 9 days. Svennevig et al. used a range of geophysical tools to detail the sequence of events that occurred and then determined the origin of the global signal. The authors found that the signal was generated by standing waves in the Dickson fjord due to the rockslide. Climate change drives feedback among the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and mass wasting events, and signals such as the one the authors observed may provide a different way of understanding these interactions. —Brent Grocholski",

    "abstract": "Seismic instruments placed outside of spatially extensive hazard zones can be used to rapidly sense a range of mass movements. However, it remains challenging to automatically detect specific events of interest. Benford's law, which states that the first non‐zero digit of given data sets follows a specific probability distribution, can provide a computationally cheap approach to identifying anomalies in large data sets and potentially be used for event detection. Here, we select vertical component seismograms to derive the first digit distribution. The seismic signals generated by debris flows follow Benford's law, while those generated by ambient noise do not. We propose the physical and mathematical explanations for the occurrence of Benford's law in debris flows. Our finding of limited seismic data from landslides, lahars, bedload transports, and glacial lake outburst floods indicates that these events may follow Benford's Law, whereas rockfalls do not. Focusing on debris flows in the Illgraben, Switzerland, our Benford's law‐based detector is comparable to an existing random forest model that was trained on 70 features and six seismic stations. Achieving a similar result based on Benford's law requires only 12 features and single station data. We suggest that Benford's law is a computationally cheap, novel technique that offers an alternative for event recognition and potentially for real‐time warnings.",

    "abstract": "Passive seismic monitoring (PSM) is emerging as a tool for detecting rockfall events and pre‐failure seismicity. In this paper, the potential of PSM for rockfall monitoring is assessed through a case study carried out in Gros‐Morne, Eastern Québec, in a region with prominent roadside cliffs, where more than 500 fallen rocks are found on the main regional road each year. The proposed method relies on using sensitive STA‐LTA windows to detect a very large number of seismic events and build a comprehensive catalog. In total, more than 70,000 seismic events were detected over one year. Gaussian mixtures are used to partition the data set. Based on visual inspection of the data, a main working hypothesis is that the seismic events can be clustered into three groups. After analyzing the spatio‐temporal distribution of the events in each group, we find that the events of one cluster can be associated with anthropogenic activity. The frequency of occurrence of the events of the different clusters and their link with meteorological data is also examined through a regression exercise, to assess the importance of the meteorological variables as explanatory variables. The results allow us to postulate on the physical origins of the signals in the different clusters, attributing them to rockfall activity and wind‐induced seismic noise.",

    "abstract": "The properties of rockfalls, such as the volume and geometry of the detached rock mass as well as the number and diameter of rock fragments, greatly affect their propagated behavior, and different strategies are required to mitigate rockfall hazards. Landquakes generated by rockfalls are regarded as good proxies for those properties. To explore the free‐fall impact dynamics of rockfalls, a series of free‐fall experiments on granular masses were designed and conducted with the characteristics of the generated landquakes versus initial variables being analyzed. The results show that the particle diameter is a dominant factor affecting landquakes, with the most significant effect on the mean frequency. The impact area is another key factor, with which both the maximum seismic amplitude and radiated seismic energy have strong positive correlations, while the mean frequency of landquakes shows a weak negative correlation. The maximum seismic amplitude appears to have a poor correlation with the numbers of layers of the free‐falling granular masses, and it was proven that the maximum seismic amplitude is determined by only the lower part of the granular masses. Quantitative relationships between the number of particles and seismic signal characteristics indicate that disintegration needs to be accounted for when landquakes are used to investigate the characteristics of a rockfall. Moreover, the frequency of landquakes decreases with a decrease in the vertical velocity and increase in the horizontal velocity during granular mass collapse.",

Here we investigated the formation mechanism of a special CGHC event in 2018, in the Sedongpu Glacier, Eastern Himalayas, China. Based on the multi‐source remote sensing, seismic signal analysis, and numerical simulation, we conducted long‐term retrospective analysis and co‐event process reconstruction. The results show that the event could be divided into two phases. First, the hanging glacier with a volume of 8.5 × 106 m3 collapsed onto the downstream trunk glacier. Next, ∼1.17 × 108 m3 eroded materials from the impacted glacier transformed into debris flow and traveled downstream 8 km. During the cascading process, ice‐rock avalanche momentum and glacier velocity are key factors in determining CGHC formation and eventual volume. Our study helps better understand the domino effects of the CGHC disaster.",

    "abstract": "While geodetic measurements have long been used to assess landslides, seismic methods are increasingly recognized as valuable tools for providing additional insights into subsurface structures and mechanisms. This work aims to characterize the subsurface structures of the deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) at Heinzenberg through the integration of active and passive seismic measurements. Seismic techniques can hereby deliver additional information on the subsurface structure and mechanisms involved, e.g., the degree of rock mass degradation, the resonant frequencies of the potentially unstable compartments, and the local fracture network orientations that are influenced by wavefield polarization. By employing advanced methods such as H/V analysis, site-to-reference spectral ratios, polarization analysis, surface wave analysis, and the joint multizonal transdimensional Bayesian inversion of velocity structures, we establish a comprehensive baseline model of the landslide at five selected sites. This baseline model shall help identify potential changes after the refilling of Lake Lüsch, which started in 2021. Our results reveal the rupture surface of the DSGSD at various depths ranging from 30 m at the top to over 90 m in the middle of the slope. Additionally, we estimate key parameters including the shear wave velocities of the different rock masses.

    "abstract": "Abstract. Understanding the dynamics of slope instabilities is critical to mitigate the associated hazards, but their direct observation is often difficult due to their remote locations and their spontaneous nature. Seismology allows us to get unique information on these events, including on their dynamics. However, the link between the properties of these events (mass and kinematics) and the seismic signals generated is still poorly understood. We conducted a controlled rockfall experiment in the Riou Bourdoux torrent (southern French Alps) to try to better decipher those links. We deployed a dense seismic network and inferred the dynamics of the block from the reconstruction of the 3D trajectory from terrestrial and airborne high-resolution stereophotogrammetry. We propose a new approach based on machine learning to predict the mass and the velocity of each block. Our results show that we can predict those quantities with average errors of approximately 10 % for the velocity and 25 % for the mass. These accuracies are as good as or better than those obtained by other approaches, but our approach has the advantage in that it does not require the source to be localised, nor does it require a high-resolution velocity model or a strong assumption on the seismic wave attenuation model. Finally, the machine learning approach allows us to explore more widely the correlations between the features of the seismic signal generated by the rockfalls and their physical properties, and it might eventually lead to better constraints on the physical models in the future.\n",

    "abstract": "Prompt detection of landslides is crucial for reducing the disaster risk and preventing landslides. However, landslide detection in practical applications still faces many challenges, such as the complexity of environmental backgrounds, the diversity of target scales, and the enormity of model weights. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight LBE-YOLO model for real-time landslide detection. Firstly, a lightweight model is designed by integrating the GhostConv lightweight network with the YOLOv8n model. Inspired by GhostConv, this study innovatively designed the GhostC2f structure, which leverages linear thinking to further reduce the model parameters and computational burden. Additionally, the newly designed EGC2f structure, incorporating an attention mechanism, not only maintains the model’s lightweight characteristics but also enhances the network’s capability to extract valid information. Subsequently, the Path Aggregation Network (PAN) was optimized by introducing a bidirectional feature propagation mechanism to improve the model’s feature fusion ability. Additionally, the Bijie landslide dataset was expanded through data augmentation strategies, thereby further improving the model’s generalization capability. The experimental results indicate that, compared to the YOLOv8n model, the proposed model increased accuracy by 4.2%, while the model’s weight and computational load were reduced by 32.0% and 35.5%, respectively. This verifies the superiority of the LBE-YOLO model in landslide target detection, which will help mitigate the impacts of natural disasters.",

    "abstract": "Extreme floods are known to severely reorganise inhabited landscapes by inundation, clogging, scouring and damaging infrastructure and lives. However, their post-event impacts are poorly understood, especially concerning coupled hillslope channel feedbacks such as the reactivation of slope instabilities connected to the river and that may be able to block it upon sudden failure. The July 2021 Ahr valley flood exemplified this ability of concurrent and sustained landscape reorganisation. Here, we study a retrogressive slope instability near the town of Müsch, in the upper Ahr valley using field mapping, repeat airborne laser scanning, electrical resistivity tomography and passive seismic monitoring to reveal the failure geometry, its mechanisms and transient activity. The old landslide developed in lower Devonian rocks. It is 100 m wide, 200 m long and approximately 15–20 m deep, which leads to a total volume of about 430,000 m3. This landslide was severely undercut by the 2021 flood with 7000 m3 of material eroded at the landslide toe. The landslide has started to react. Given the narrow section of the river at this location, there is a potential landslide dam hazard. We modelled the inundation volumes and back fill times for different failure scenarios, ranging between 20,000 m3 and 330,000 m3 accumulating within 5 min and 20 h. Our results imply a need to systematically screen flood impacted landscapes for sustained post-event hillslope activity that governs hillslope-channel coupling, driving both persistent sediment injection into the stream and sudden river blocking and subsequent damming.",

Researchers investigated a retrogressive slope instability in the Ahr valley after the July 2021 flood using multiple methods.

The research suggests a potential landslide dam hazard and the need for systematic screening of flood-impacted areas.",

On 7 February 2021, a huge rock–ice mass detached from the Raunthi peak at Chamoli district in Uttarakhand, India. The tragic catastrophe resulted in more than 200 deaths and significant economic losses. Here, we analyse radon concentration and seismic signals to characterise the potential precursory anomalies prior to the detachment. Continuous peaks of radon anomalies were observed from the afternoon of 5 to 7 February and decreased suddenly after the event, while a cumulative number of seismic tremors and amplitude variations are more intensified ~2.30 h before the main event, indicating a static to dynamic phase change within the weak zone. This study not only characterises abnormal signals but also models the rock failure mechanisms. The analysis unveils three time‐dependent nucleation phases, physical mechanisms of signal generation and a complete scenario of physical factors that affected the degree of criticality of slope failure. The results of this study suggest gradual progression of rock cracks/joints, subsequent material creep and slip advancement acceleration preceded the final failure. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of an early warning system to mitigate the impact of events like the 2021 Chamoli rock–ice avalanche.",

By studying seismic velocity variations, we quantify the physical changes in rocks induced by long‐term volcanic deformation and the dynamic changes associated with the 2017 Casamicciola earthquake (Mw 3.9) in the active volcanic complex of Ischia Island, Italy. Our study reveals a significant dynamic velocity reduction (∼0.2%), primarily due to near‐surface damage, with a permanent drop linked to documented landslides and subsidence observed immediately after the earthquake. We also identified a positive long‐term linear trend in velocity variations, indicative of a generalized contraction of the Ischia Caldera, as revealed by geodetic modeling. Our results suggest a depressurization of the shallow hydrothermal system through degassing along faults or sills.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Cryoseismology is a powerful toolset for progressing the understanding of the structure and dynamics of glaciers and ice sheets. It can enable the detection of hidden processes such as brittle fracture, basal sliding, transient hydrological processes, and calving. Addressing the challenge of detecting signals from many different processes, we present a novel approach for the semi-automated detection of events and event-like noise, which is well-suited for use as Part 1 of a workflow where unsupervised machine learning will be used as Part 2 (Latto et al., 2024) to facilitate the main reconnaissance of diverse detected event types. Implemented in the open-source and widely used ObsPy Python package, the multi-STA/LTA algorithm constructs a hybrid characteristic function from a set of short-term average (sta)–long-term average (lta) pairs (refer to Sect. 2 in the main text for an explanation of how uppercase and lowercase STA/sta and LTA/lta abbreviations are differentiated). We apply the algorithm to data from a seismic array deployed on the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) in West Antarctica (austral summer 2010–2011) to form a “catch-all” catalogue of events and event-like noise. The new algorithm compares favorably with standard approaches, yielding a diversity of seismic events, including all previously identified stick-slip events (Pratt et al., 2014), teleseisms, and other noise-type signals. In terms of a catalogue overview, we investigate a partial association of seismicity with the tidal cycle and a slight association with ice temperature changes of the Antarctic summer. The new algorithm and workflow will assist in the comparison of different glacier environments using seismology, the identification of process change over time, and the targeting of possible subsequent high-resolution studies.\n",

However, smaller-aperture seismic arrays can also be used, which are typically sensitive to seismicity distal from the array footprint and require a smaller number of instruments. Here, we investigate the potential of arrays and array-processing methods to detect and locate subsurface microseismicity at glaciers, benchmarking performance against conventional seismic-network-based methods for an example at an Antarctic ice stream. We also provide an array-processing recipe for body-wave cryoseismology applications. Results from an array and a network deployed at Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica, show that arrays and networks both have strengths and weaknesses. Arrays can detect icequakes from further distances, whereas networks outperform arrays in more comprehensive studies of a particular process due to greater hypocentral constraint within the network extent. We also gain new insights into seismic behaviour at the Rutford Ice Stream. The array detects basal icequakes in what was previously interpreted to be an aseismic region of the bed, as well as new icequake observations downstream and at the ice stream shear margins, where it would be challenging to deploy instruments. Finally, we make some practical recommendations for future array deployments at glaciers.\n",

    "abstract": "\n Slope disasters, such as landslides and rockfalls, can cause significant safety issues for land and road use in many countries. Therefore, it is important to have effective monitoring and early warning systems in place. Although using images or closed-circuit televisions have some limitations, using seismic data for monitoring can provide real-time information, are useful at night, and are less affected by weather conditions. However, a lack of seismic recordings for different types of slope disasters can limit the use of the seismic method. To collect more seismic recordings, we deployed seismometers in the Luhu mountain area of Miaoli, Taiwan, to record rockfalls, earthquakes, and other natural and human-induced events. To cluster the different types of seismic waveforms present in these recordings, we used deep embedded clustering (DEC), an unsupervised clustering algorithm, to group the recordings based on their features. We selected waveforms with significantly larger amplitudes than background noise and converted them to spectrograms using the short-time Fourier transform as input for DEC. About 45,000 seismic recordings were selected, of which 1951 were manually labeled source classes as external information for finding an optimal number of clusters and evaluating clustering results. The DEC clustering results showed that most seismic recordings of different source classes had distinct features and could be grouped into different clusters. However, different classes of seismic recordings may be assigned to the same cluster if they have similar features on spectrograms but can still be distinguished by other conditions. By utilizing unsupervised clustering to categorize a large number of seismic recordings based on their features, the time required for manual classification can be reduced. The identified seismic recordings of rockfalls will be useful for monitoring and analyzing rockfall hazards using seismic data.",

    "abstract": "Our warming climate is adversely affecting cryospheric landscapes via glacial retreat, permafrost degradation, and associated slope destabilization. In Prince William Sound, Alaska, the rapid retreat of Barry Glacier has destabilized the slopes flanking the glacier, resulting in numerous landslides. The largest of these landslides (∼500 Mm3 in volume) is more than 2 km wide and has the potential to generate a tsunami that could affect nearby recreationists, marine traffic, infrastructure, natural and cultural resources, and the community of Whittier, located 60 km from the landslide. Here, we combine landslide structural and kinematic element mapping with data acquired from bi‐yearly airborne lidar, multi‐week satellite‐based synthetic aperture radar (SAR), sub‐hourly ground‐based SAR, and seismic monitoring from 2020 to 2022 to characterize this landslide and examine its evolution. While some methods serve as a snapshot in time that is a culmination of events, others emphasize the ever‐evolving nature of the landslide and associated hazards. Four major kinematic elements define the overall structure of the landslide, which vary in deformation type and rate, from creep (5 mm per day over several months) to episodic movement (2 m in 30 days) and landslide‐wide to localized events. In some areas of the landslide, short‐term deformation deviates from structures formed by cumulative movement, implying structural and kinematic evolution associated with glacier retreat. These insights are important for assessing landslide hazards and hazard evolution for large, slow‐moving bedrock landslides in actively deglaciating environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Climate shifts are particularly conspicuous in glaciated areas. Satellite and terrestrial observations show significant increases in the melting and breakup of tidewater glaciers and their influence on sea level rise and ocean mixing. Increasing melt rates are creating an urgency to better understand the link between atmospheric and oceanic conditions and glacier frontal ablation through iceberg calving and melting. Elucidating this link requires a combination of short- and long-timescale measurements of terminus activity. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of using underwater sound to quantify the time and scale of calving events to yield integrated estimates of ice mass loss (Glowacki and Deane, 2020). Here, we present estimates of subaerial calving flux using underwater sound recorded at Hansbreen, Svalbard, in September 2013 combined with an algorithm for the automatic detection of calving events. The method is compared with ice calving volumes estimated from geodetic measurements of the movement of the glacier terminus and an analysis of satellite images. The total volume of above-water calving during the 26 d of acoustical observation is estimated to be 1.7±0.7×107 m3, whereas the subaerial calving flux estimated by traditional methods is 7±2×106 m3. The results suggest that passive cryoacoustics is a viable technique for long-term monitoring of mass loss from marine-terminating glaciers.\n",

    "abstract": "Gravitational mass wasting prediction requires understanding of the factors controlling failure. Prior to slope failure, cracks in the weakened rock are thought to grow and coalesce, eventually forming a continuous failure plane. Here, we apply a hidden Markov machine learning model to seismic data, revealing the temporal evolution of cracks prior to a major rockslide event in the Swiss Alps. After prolonged linear increase of the crack cumulative number, an S-shaped crack rate pattern occurred in the day before the rockslide. A simple mechanistic model can explain this behaviour, showing that total crack boundary length is the key factor controlling failure plane evolution immediately before mass movement. Our findings imply that cracks should be treated as 2-D, rather than 1-D objects, and that slope failure can be driven predominantly by internal rather than external processes. Our model offers a novel, physically based approach for early warning of slope failures.",

    "abstract": "Seismological data plays a crucial role in timely slope failure hazard assessments. However, identifying rockfall waveforms from seismic data poses challenges due to their high variability across different events and stations. To address this, we propose RockNet, a deep-learning-based multitask model capable of detecting both rockfall and earthquake events at both the single-station and local seismic network levels. RockNet consists of two submodels: the single-station model, which computes waveform masks for earthquake and rockfall signals and performs earthquake $P$ and $S$ phase picking simultaneously on single-station seismograms, and the association model, which determines the occurrences of local seismic events by aggregating hidden feature maps from the trained single-station model across all stations. Since the rockfall data is relatively scarce and may not be sufficient to train a deep-learning model effectively, we augment the dataset with abundant nonrockfall data and add additional tasks to promote shared interpretability and robustness. RockNet is trained and tested on a local dataset collected from the Luhu tribe in Miaoli, Taiwan, achieving macro F1-scores of 0.983 and 0.990 for the single-station model and the association model, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluate RockNet on an independent dataset collected from the Super-Sauze unstable slope region in France, and it demonstrates good generalization performance in discriminating earthquake, rockfall, and noise with a macro F1-score of 0.927. This study highlights the potential of deep learning in leveraging diverse types of inputs for seismic signal detection even with limited training data.",

The choice of a suitable model and its parameters and a confident calibration strategy are crucial for numerical simulations. Here, we evaluated two constitutive models with a three‐dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method by simulating the catastrophic 11 October 2018 Baige landslide. The results indicate that both the soil mechanic and fluid models can capture the dynamic runout and deposition morphology while using different values of input parameters. A point‐wise comparison of deposit elevation can minimize the calibration error. Numerical models were constrained accurately by utilizing both the static observation data and dynamic seismic signals. The effects of friction on deep‐seated landslides motion and deposition are more significant than cohesion. The 3D model includes the effects of shear stresses and velocities inside the material body, resulting in a reduced friction coefficient compared to the 2D model (e.g., depth‐averaged model). Our study highlights the potential of the 3D SPH method for modeling large‐scale complex landslides.",

In this study, we integrate eyewitness videos and seismic records of the event with meteorological data, field observations, pre- and post-event satellite imagery, and uncrewed aircraft vehicle imagery to characterize the event and future hazards it may pose. Deformation of the eventual slide mass preceded rapid failure by decades, starting in the early to mid-2000s, accelerating in 2018 (the warmest year on record), and reaching ~ 20 m/year in 2021. The main event, which was preceded by smaller sliding episodes earlier that day, had a volume of ~ 2.1 million m3, reached peak velocities of about 5 m/s, slid on a surface up to 80 m deep, and moved up to ~ 245 m downslope in < 2 min. We observed blocks of frozen debris (permafrost) in the landslide deposits. Within ~ 2 weeks, these blocks had melted and became dry, conical debris mounds (molards). We hypothesize that the rapid slide was induced by gradually increasing long-term air temperatures that thawed ice and increased pore pressures. The presence and suspected influence of permafrost on the occurrence of this landslide indicate other slopes in the park, and other moderate-to-low latitude alpine regions may experience similar slope stability issues as temperatures continue to warm.",

The research integrates seismic data, field observations, and remote sensing techniques to understand the event. Findings indicate that the landslide was preceded by decades of deformation, accelerating with rising temperatures. The authors hypothesize that thawing ice and increased pore pressures due to warming temperatures may have contributed to the rapid slide.",

    "abstract": "Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) are dangerous flows of volcanic rock and gas that are the most deadly proximal volcano hazard. There is significant interest in better understanding PDC dynamics, however, they are challenging to study due to their extreme hazard, unpredictable occurrence, and because complex internal dynamics are obscured by visually opaque clouds of ash. PDCs exert forces on Earth's surface and generate seismic waves. Here, we use seismic data recorded by the permanent monitoring network at Mt. Etna (Italy) to track the 11 February 2014 PDC at second‐scale temporal resolution and calculate a maximum velocity of 76 m/s (274 km/hr). We identify multiple pulses and show that the late‐stage source locations correspond with the mapped coarse‐grained PDC deposits. High temporal and spatial resolution measurements of PDC movement from seismic data can be used to inform numerical modeling of PDC dynamics and aid in hazard assessment by improving our understanding of PDC flow paths. This work illustrates how seismic signals can be used to track surficial mass movements in real‐time.",

In these and other areas of study, acoustic methods have found useful application to detect and quantify the operation of important landscape processes. In some, such as the recording of river discharge, the occurrence of rare events such as exfoliation or the presence and movement of dust devils (willy-willies), the use of acoustic methods is still in a relatively early stage of development and testing. The use of acoustic methods in the recording of rainfall occurrence and intensity is also developing and has the capacity to yield data with higher temporal resolution than can be achieved using conventional rain gauges. Novel acoustic methods include the analysis of the sound recorded by security cameras, which potentially form a vast network of observing stations. The frequencies of sound generated by land-surface processes include audible sound, ultrasound and infrasound at frequencies below the human hearing range. All appear to provide opportunities for further development of useful research tools and methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Continuous seismic signals are proposed as a useful quantitative information source for the estimation of rockfall properties. However, few studies have examined the characteristics of the seismic signal of fragmentation‐related rockfalls. In this study, a series of laboratory experiments designed with crushable analog blocks freefalling and impacting on a thin horizontal plate under different initial conditions (e.g., block volume, strength and fall height) were conducted. Strong correlations are observed between the rockfall properties and the seismic parameters when considering the rock fragmentation during impact. However, these relationships are observed only when the variation in potential energy spans over one order of magnitude, indicating that the application of seismic signals is limited by rockfall properties. In particular, the seismic energy calculated by the diffuse method is the most stable seismic parameter that is highly correlated with the potential energy of rockfalls. By compiling the available data of the seismic signals of both natural and experimental rockfalls from previous studies and our experiments, we found that the relationship between the seismic energy and the potential energy of rockfalls follows a power law model at all scales. The exponent of the power law function ranges from 1.11 to 1.69. Rock strength can significantly affect the seismic features, which are quantitatively discussed. Rock fragmentation acts as an intermediate variable, which is controlled by rockfall properties and consequently affects the corresponding seismic characteristics. Furthermore, rock fragmentation reduces the efficiency of the conversion of potential energy to seismic energy of rockfalls.",
    "summary": "This study explores the seismic signals produced by rockfalls that involve fragmentation. The researchers conducted laboratory experiments using crushable blocks to simulate rockfalls under controlled conditions. They found correlations between rockfall properties, fragmentation, and seismic parameters, particularly seismic energy. These results suggest that seismic signals can provide information about rockfall properties, although the relationship is influenced by rock strength and energy conversion efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Inversion of low‐frequency regional seismic records to solve for a time series of bulk forces exerted on the earth by a landslide (a force‐time function) is increasingly being used to infer volumes and dynamics of large, highly energetic landslides, such as rock avalanches and flowslides, and to provide calibration information on event dynamics and volumes for numerical landslide runout models. Much of the work to date using landslide runout modeling constrained by seismic data has focused on using single‐phase models with frictional or velocity‐weakening rheologies. Awareness of multistage landslide initiations is increasing, with discrete failures separated in time contributing to the final impact of an event. Our work utilizes a method for incorporating seismic data as a calibration constraint for landslide runout models, considering variable rheologies and different initiation conditions. This study presents a systematic examination of multiple rheologies and initiation conditions, and shows how these factors affect the force‐time function derived from the landslide runout model. Our work confirms that, while rheology and fragmenting or initially coherent initiations affect the force‐time function, multiple collapses separated by tens of seconds have the greatest impact on the shape and amplitude. We apply this method to the analysis of three real rock avalanches to better constrain plausible initiation conditions and rheology parameters using both seismic and field data. This study provides insights on how assumptions about the initiation dynamics of the source zone and the runout model definition can aid in the interpretation of seismic inversions for multistage rock avalanches.",
    "summary": "This study examines the behavior of multistage rock avalanches. The approach uses runout modeling that is constrained by seismic inversions. The research explores how rheology and initiation conditions affect the force-time function. The findings suggest that multiple collapses significantly impact the force-time function, which can inform interpretations of seismic inversions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. There are on average 35 fatal mountaineering accidents per summer in France. On average, since 1990, 3.7 of them have occurred every summer in the Grand Couloir du Goûter, on the classic route up Mont Blanc (4809 m a.s.l.). Rockfall is one of the main factors that explain this high accident rate and contribute to making it one of the most accident-prone areas in the Alps for mountaineers. In this particular context, the objective of this study is to document the rockfall activity and its triggering factors in the Grand Couloir du Goûter in order to disseminate the results to mountaineers and favour their adaptation to the local rockfall hazard. Using a multi-method monitoring system (five seismic sensors, an automatic digital camera, three rock subsurface temperature sensors, a traffic sensor, a high-resolution topographical survey, two weather stations and a rain gauge), we acquired a continuous database on rockfalls during a period of 68 d in 2019 and some of their potential triggering factors (precipitation, ground and air temperatures, snow cover, frequentation by climbers). At the seasonal scale, our results confirm\nprevious studies showing that rockfalls are most frequent during the\nsnowmelt period in permafrost-affected rockwalls. Furthermore, the\nunprecedented time precision and completeness of our rockfall database at\nhigh elevation thanks to seismic sensors allowed us to investigate the factors triggering rockfalls. We found a clear correlation between rockfall frequency and air temperature, with a 2 h delay between peak air temperature and peak rockfall activity. A small number of rockfalls seem to be triggered by mountaineers. Our data set shows that climbers are not aware of the variations in rockfall frequency and/or cannot/will not adapt their behaviour to this hazard. These results should help to define an adaptation strategy for climbers. Therefore, we disseminated our results within the mountaineering community thanks to the full integration of our results into the management of the route by local actors. Knowledge built during this experiment has already been used for the definition and implementation of management measures for the attendance in summer 2020.\n",
    "summary": "This study investigates rockfall activity on the classic route up Mont Blanc, a site with a high rate of mountaineering accidents. A multi-method monitoring system was used to collect data on rockfalls and potential triggering factors over a 68-day period in 2019.

The results were disseminated to the mountaineering community to encourage adaptation to the rockfall hazard.",

    "abstract": "Deformation mechanisms of glaciers are highly sensitive to basal temperature; the motion of temperate glaciers is dominated by basal slip while cold‐based glaciers deform mainly by internal creep. While basal slip is usually aseismic, unstable slip sometimes occurs and can be detected by seismometers. I have detected clusters of repeating low‐frequency icequakes (LFIs) in the Mont‐Blanc massif. Some properties of LFIs are similar to the high‐frequency icequakes (HFIs) located at the base of Argentière glacier (Helmstetter, Nicolas, et al., 2015, https://doi.org/10.1002/2014jf003288). Both HFIs and LFIs occur as bursts of tens to several thousand events lasting for days or weeks, with typical inter‐event times of several minutes during bursts. Unlike HFIs that have a broad spectra, LFIs have a characteristic frequency of about 5 Hz at all stations, suggesting a rupture length of about 100 m. Seismic amplitudes and seismic waveforms of LFIs progressively evolve with time within each cluster, suggesting changes in either rupture length or rupture velocity. Most LFIs are detected during snowfall episodes while HFIs are not correlated with snowfall episodes. In this study, I used all available seismic stations within or around the Mont‐Blanc massif between 2017 and 2022. I found LFIs located all over the massif but mainly above 3,000 m. Some clusters are clearly associated with cold basal ice (near Mont‐Blanc summit) while others below 2,700 m a.s.l. are likely located under temperate glaciers and two clusters could be associated with landslides. This observation of LFIs on cold glaciers is consistent with laboratory friction experiments suggesting that cold ice promotes unstable slip (McCarthy et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2015.0348; Saltiel et al., 2021, https://doi.org/10.1785/0220200480; Zoet et al., 2013, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1002/jgrf.20052, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gl088964).",
    "summary": "This study investigates repeating low-frequency icequakes (LFIs) in the Mont-Blanc massif using seismic data from 2017 to 2022. The research identifies LFI clusters throughout the massif, primarily at higher altitudes. A key finding is that most LFIs correlate with snowfall events, unlike high-frequency icequakes. The observation of LFIs on cold glaciers may support the idea that cold ice facilitates unstable slip.",

    "abstract": "\n A change in surface loading causes the Earth’s surface to deform. Mass movements, such as debris flows, can cause a tilt large enough to be recorded by nearby instruments, but the signal is strongly dependent on the mass loading and subsurface parameters. Specifically designed sensors for such measurements (tiltmeters) are cumbersome to install. Alternatively, broadband seismometers record translational motion and also tilt signals, often at periods of tens to hundreds of seconds. Their horizontal components are thereby the most sensitive to tilt. In this study, we show how to obtain tilt caused by the passing by of debris flows from seismic measurements recorded within tens of meters of the flow and investigate the usefulness of this signal for flow characterization. We investigate the problem on three scales (1) large-scale laboratory experiments at the U.S. Geological Survey debris-flow flume, where broadband seismometers and tiltmeters were installed for six 8–10  m3 experiments, (2) the Illgraben torrent in Switzerland, one of the most active mass wasting sites in the European Alps, where a broadband seismometer placed within a few meters of the channel recorded 15 debris-flow events with volumes up to 105  m3, and (3) Volcán de Fuego, Guatemala, where a broadband seismometer recorded two lahars. We investigate how the tilt signals compare to debris-flow parameters such as mean normal stresses, usually measured by expensive force plates, and debris-flow height. We model the elastic ground deformation as the response of an elastic half-space to a moving surface load. In addition, we use the model with some simplifications to determine the maximum debris-flow heights of Volcán de Fuego events, where no force plate measurements are available. Finally, we address how and under what assumptions the relatively affordable and straightforward tilt measurements may be utilized to infer debris-flow parameters, as opposed to force plates and other complicated instrument setups.",
    "summary": "This study examines ground deformation caused by surface loading from debris flows. Researchers used seismometer records to measure tilt induced by these flows at different scales. They compared tilt signals to debris-flow parameters, such as mean normal stresses and flow height. The study models ground deformation and explores using tilt measurements to infer debris-flow parameters.",

    "abstract": "Future missions carrying seismometer payloads to icy ocean worlds will measure global and local seismicity to determine where the ice shell is seismically active. We use two locations, a seismically active site on Gulkana Glacier, Alaska, and a more seismically quiet site on the northwestern Greenland Ice Sheet as geophysical analogs. We compare the performance of a single‐station seismometer against a small‐aperture seismic array to detect both high (>1 Hz) and low (<0.1 Hz) frequency events at each site. We created catalogs of high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) seismicity at each location using an automated short‐term average/long‐term average technique. We find that with a 1‐m small‐aperture seismic array, our detection rate increased (9% for Alaska and 46% for Greenland) over the single‐station approach. At Gulkana, we recorded an order of magnitude greater HF events than the Greenland site. We ascribe the HF events sources to a combination of icequakes, rockfalls, and ice‐water interactions, while very HF events are determined to result from bamboo poles that were used to secure gear. We further find that local environmental noise reduces the ability to detect LF global tectonic events. Based upon this study, we recommend that (a) future missions consider the value of the expanded capability of a small array compared to a single station, (b) design detection algorithms that can accommodate variable environmental noise, and (c) assess the potential landings sites for sources of local environmental noise that may limit detection of global events.",

Previous work has shown that measurements of ground vibrations are capable of detecting the timing, speed, and location of debris flows. A remaining question is to what extent additional flow properties, such as grain‐size distribution and flow depth can be inferred reliably from seismic data. Here, we experimentally explore the relation of seismic vibrations and normal‐force fluctuations with debris‐flow composition and dynamics. We use a 5.4 m long and 0.3 m wide channel inclined at 20°, equipped with a geophone plate and force plate. We show that seismic vibrations and normal‐force fluctuations induced by debris flows are strongly correlated, and that both are affected by debris‐flow composition. We find that the effects of the large‐particle distribution on seismic vibrations and normal‐force fluctuations are substantially more pronounced than the effects of water fraction, clay fraction, and flow volume, especially when normalized by flow depth. We further show that for flows with similar coarse‐particle distributions seismic vibrations and normal‐force fluctuations can be reasonably well related to flow depth, even if total flow volume, water fraction, and the size distribution of fines varies. Our experimental results shed light on how changes in large‐particle, clay, and water fractions affect the seismic and force‐fluctuation signatures of debris flows, and provide important guidelines for their interpretation.",

    "abstract": "The number of gigaton‐sized iceberg‐calving events occurring annually at Greenland glaciers is increasing, part of a larger trend of accelerating mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Though visual observation of large calving events is rare, ∼60 glacial earthquakes generated by these calving events are currently recorded each year by regional and global seismic stations. An empirical relationship between iceberg size and MCSF, a summary measure of glacial‐earthquake size, was recently demonstrated by Olsen and Nettles (2019), https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JF005054. However, MCSF is known to be sensitive to choices made in modeling the seismic source. We incorporate constraints on the seismic source from laboratory studies of calving and test multiple source time functions using synthetic and observed glacial‐earthquake waveforms. We find that a simple, fixed time function with a shape informed by laboratory results greatly improves estimates of earthquake size. The average ratio of estimated to true peak force values is 1.03 for experiments using our preferred source model, compared with an average of 0.3 for models used in previous studies. We find that maximum‐force values estimated from waveform modeling depend far less on model choices than does MCSF, and therefore prefer maximum force as a measure of glacial‐earthquake size. Using both synthetic and real data, we confirm a correlation between maximum force and iceberg mass. Our results support the possibility of developing useful scaling relationships between seismic observables and physical parameters controlling glacier calving.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. In mountainous areas, rockfalls, rock avalanches, and debris flows constitute a risk to human life and property. Seismology has proven a useful tool to monitor such mass movements, while increasing data volumes and availability of real-time data streams demand new solutions for automatic signal classification. Ideally, seismic monitoring arrays have large apertures and record a significant number of mass movements to train detection algorithms. However, this is rarely the case, as a result of cost and time constraints and the rare occurrence of catastrophic mass movements. Here, we use the supervised random forest algorithm to classify windowed seismic data on a continuous data stream. We investigate algorithm performance for signal classification into noise (NO), slope failure (SF), and earthquake (EQ) classes and explore the influence of non-ideal though commonly encountered conditions: poor network coverage, imbalanced data sets, and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). To this end we use data from two separate locations in the Swiss Alps: data set (i), recorded at Illgraben, contains signals of several dozen slope failures with low SNR; data set (ii), recorded at Pizzo Cengalo, contains only five slope failure events albeit with higher SNR. The low SNR of slope failure events in data set (i) leads to a classification accuracy of 70 % for SF, with the largest confusion between NO and SF. Although data set (ii) is highly imbalanced, lowering the prediction threshold for slope failures leads to a prediction accuracy of 80 % for SF, with the largest confusion between SF and EQ. Standard techniques to mitigate training data imbalance do not increase prediction accuracy. The classifier of data set (ii) is then used to train a model for the classification of 176 d of continuous seismic recordings containing four slope failure events. The model classifies eight events as slope failures, of which two are snow avalanches, and one is a rock-slope failure. The other events are local or regional earthquakes. By including earthquake detection of a permanent seismic station at 131 km distance to the test site into the decision-making process, all earthquakes falsely classified as slope failures can be excluded. Our study shows that, even for limited training data and non-optimal network geometry, machine learning algorithms applied to high-quality seismic records can be used to monitor mass movements automatically.",
    "summary": "This study addresses the challenge of automatically classifying seismic signals related to slope failures. A supervised random forest algorithm was used to classify seismic data into noise, slope failure, and earthquake categories. The algorithm's performance was tested using data from two locations in the Swiss Alps, considering factors like network coverage and signal-to-noise ratios. The results suggest that machine learning algorithms can be applied to seismic records for automated monitoring of mass movements, even with limited training data.",

    "abstract": "\n About 70% of Earth’s surface is covered by ocean, for which seismic observations are challenging. Seafloor seismology overcame this fundamental difficulty and radically transformed the earth sciences, as it expanded the coverage of seismic networks and revealed otherwise inaccessible features. At the same time, there has been a recent increase in the number of studies on cryoseismology. These have yielded multiple discoveries but are limited primarily to land and ice-surface receivers. Near ice calving fronts, such surface stations are noisy, primarily due to crevassing and wind, are hazardous to maintain, and can be lost due to iceberg calving. To circumvent these issues, we have applied ocean-bottom seismology to the calving front of a tidewater glacier in northwest Greenland. We present details of this experiment, and describe the technical challenges, noise analysis, and examples of recorded data. This includes tide-modulated seismicity with thousands of icequakes per day and the first near-source (∼200–640  m) underwater record of a major kilometer-scale calving event in Greenland, which generated a glacial earthquake that was detectable ∼420  km away. We also identified a decrease in bottom-water temperature, presumably due to modified water stratification driven by extreme Greenland glacial melting, at the end of July 2019. Importantly, we identify glacial sediments as the key reason for the anomalously long (∼9.7  hr) delay in the sensor release from the fjord seafloor. Our study demonstrates a methodology to undertake innovative, interdisciplinary, near-source studies on glacier basal sliding, calving, and marine-mammal vocalizations.",

This includes tide-modulated seismicity with thousands of icequakes per day and the first near-source (∼200–640  m) underwater record of a major kilometer-scale calving event in Greenland, which generated a glacial earthquake that was detectable ∼420  km away.",

    "abstract": "Shearing along subduction zones, laboratory experiments on analogue faults, and sliding along glacier beds are all associated with aseismic and co-seismic slip. In this study, an ocean-bottom seismometer is deployed near the terminus of a Greenlandic tidewater glacier, effectively insulating the signal from the extremely noisy surface seismic wavefield. Continuous, tide-modulated tremor related to ice speed is recorded at the bed of the glacier. When noise interference (for example, due to strong winds) is low, the tremor is also confirmed via analysis of seismic waveforms from surface stations. The signal resembles the tectonic tremor commonly observed during slow-earthquake events in subduction zones. We propose that the glacier sliding velocity can be retrieved from the observed seismic noise. Our approach may open new opportunities for monitoring calving-front processes in one of the most difficult-to-access cryospheric environments. Anomalously slow earthquakes play a critical role in the earthquake cycle and fault sliding. Here, the authors detect continuous seismic radiation from a glacier sliding over its bed and show persistent coastal shaking to represent an addition to the family of slow earthquakes.",

    "abstract": "Landslides have caused extensive infrastructure damage and caused human fatalities for centuries. Intense precipitation and large earthquakes are considered to be two major landslide triggers, particularly in the case of catastrophic landslides. The most widely accepted mechanistic explanation for landslides is the effective-stress dependent shear strength reduction due to increases in pore water pressure. The Chashan landslide site, selected for the present study, has been intensively studied from geological, geophysical, geodetic, geotechnical, hydrological, and seismological perspectives. Our seismic monitoring of daily relative velocity changes (dv/v) indicated that landslide material decreases coincided with the first half of the rainy period and increased during the latter half of the rainy period. The geodetic surveys before and after the rainy period identified vertical subsidence without horizontal movement. The results from the multidisciplinary investigation enabled us to draw a conceptual model of the landslide recovery process induced by water loading. Where all sliding materials were stable (safety factor > 1.0), unconsolidated landslide colluvium and impermeable sliding surfaces trapped the seepage water to form a water tank, provided that compact forces were acting on the materials below the sliding boundary. The vertical force of compaction facilitates an increase in the cohesion and strength of landslide materials, thereby increasing the landslide materials’ stability. We demonstrated that the recovery process periodically occurs only under the combined conditions of prolonged and intense precipitation and the related stability conditions.",

    "abstract": "Continuous ambient seismic monitoring of potentially unstable sites is increasingly attracting the attention of researchers for precursor recognition and early warning purposes. Twelve cases of long-term continuous noise monitoring have been reported in the literature between 2012 and 2020. Only in a few cases rupture was achieved and irreversible drops in resonance frequency values or shear wave velocity extracted from noise recordings were documented. On the other hand, all monitored sites showed clear reversible fluctuations of the seismic parameters on a daily and seasonal scale due to changes in external weather conditions (air temperature and precipitation). A quantitative comparison of these reversible modifications is used to gain insight into the mechanisms driving the site seismic response. Six possible mechanisms were identified, including three temperature-driven mechanisms (temperature control on fracture opening/closing, superficial stress conditions and bulk rigidity), one precipitation-driven mechanism (water infiltration effect) and two mechanisms sensitive to both temperature and precipitation (ice formation and clay behavior). The reversible variations in seismic parameters under the meteorological constraints are synthesized and compared to the irreversible changes observed prior to failure in different geological conditions.",
    "summary": "This review examines how seismic noise parameters serve as indicators of reversible modifications in slope stability. The authors synthesize studies showing that changes in seismic velocities, resonance frequencies, and spectral properties of ambient noise can detect seasonal and transient variations in slope conditions. The findings highlight the potential of passive seismic monitoring as a non-invasive tool for slope stability assessment and early warning.",

    "abstract": "Since 2011, seafloor temperatures, pressures, and seismic ground motions have been measured by the seafloor cabled Dense Oceanfloor Network system for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) on the Nankai margin. These measurements, high‐resolution bathymetry, and abundant contextual information make the DONET region seem ideally suited to provide constraints on seismic shaking‐triggered sediment slope failures and gravity flows, particularly since numerous published studies have linked paleo‐ to modern earthquakes to failures and flows within the DONET. The occurrences of the local 2016 M6.0 Mie‐ken and regional M7.0 Kumamoto earthquakes within and at regional distances, respectively, from the DONET data set provided an opportunity to explore this potential. We used DONET seismic recordings of the posited triggering shaking and to search for submarine slide signals and continuous temperature and pressure data to detect pulses of warm and densified water indicative of passing flows. We developed and applied a variety of analytical methods to eliminate signals generated by water column processes, while leaving slope failures and sediment gravity flow anomalies as residuals. Our explorations yielded no evidence that earthquake shaking initiated either phenomenon, which we suggest reflects the finicky nature both of the detection of and the physical processes that contribute to slope failures and flows (i.e., both require satisfying precise suites of conditions). Nonetheless, this negative result, our analyses, and the estimates of physical properties we derived for them, provide useful lessons and inputs for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Rockfall risk is usually characterized by a high frequency of occurrence, difficulty in prediction (given high velocity, lack of noticeable forerunners, abrupt collapse, and complex mechanism), and a relatively high potential vulnerability, especially against people and communication routes. Considering that larger rockfalls and rockslides are generally anticipated by an increased occurrence of events, in this study, a framework based on microseismic monitoring is introduced for a temporal and spatial rockfall early warning. This approach is realized through the detection, classification, and localization of all the rockfalls recorded during a 6-month-long microseismic monitoring performed in a limestone quarry in central Italy. Then, in order to provide a temporal warning, an observable quantity of accumulated energy, associated to the rockfall rolling and bouncing and function of the number and volume of events in a certain time window, has been defined. This concept is based on the material failure method developed by Fukuzono-Voight. As soon as the first predicted time of failure and relative warning time are declared, all the rockfalls occurred in a previous time window can be located in a topographic map to find the rockfall susceptible area and thus to complement the warning with spatial information. This methodology has been successfully validated in an ex post analysis performed in the aforementioned quarry, where a large rockfall was forecasted with a lead time of 3 min. This framework provides a novel way for rockfall spatiotemporal early warning, and it could be helpful for activating traffic lights and closing mountain roads or other transportation lines using the knowledge of the time and location of a failure. Since this approach is not based on the detection of the triggering events (like for early warnings based on rainfall thresholds), it can be used also for earthquake-induced failures.",
    "summary": "This study investigates the problem of predicting rockfalls, which are difficult to forecast but pose risks. The authors introduce a microseismic monitoring framework for early warning of rockfalls in both time and space. The framework was tested using data from a six-month monitoring period in an Italian limestone quarry. The results suggest the method can forecast rockfalls with some lead time and identify susceptible areas.",

    "abstract": "Landslides, earthquakes and other natural disasters are expected to increase in the Arctic, yet our ability to make informed decisions about safety is tightly limited by lack of data. As part of the Integrated Arctic Observation System (INTAROS) project, geophones were installed by residents in Greenland and by University of Bergen in Svalbard in 2018. The purpose of the installations was to explore challenges and benefits of community-based data collection for seismological monitoring in the Arctic region. Raspberry Shake units with one/three-component velocity sensors were selected for the deployment, due to their user-friendly configuration, easy installation, and well established digital platform and web services. The purpose of engaging community members in the use of geophone sensors was to monitor earthquakes, cryoseisms (events generated by ice mass), and landslides. We report our findings with respect to challenges regarding the installation and operation of the Raspberry Shake sensors at both locations. Connecting community-based recordings with permanent seismological networks improved both the detection capability and the data support for understanding seismic events in Greenland. In contrast, finding suitable locations for deployments in Longyearbyen turned out to be challenging, because most buildings are constructed on poles due to the permafrost and indoor space is expensive. Promoting citizen seismology in the Arctic could improve monitoring of seismic events in the Arctic while simultaneously raising community awareness of natural hazards.",

    "abstract": "Using a fully nonlinear Bayesian approach based on forward modelling of granular flow, we invert for landslide parameters (volume, release geometry and rheology) from different kinds of observations. Synthetic tests show that the runout distance and the deposit area by themselves do not constrain landslide parameters. Better constraints on landslide parameters are obtained from the thickness distribution of the landslide deposits, as well as from the force history applied by the landslide to the ground, which contains information on the landslide dynamics. Therefore, inverting force histories calculated from seismic broad-band records is an important alternative to inverting thickness distributions of landslide deposits, which are usually difficult to obtain. We test the method on the 1997 Boxing Day debris avalanche on Montserrat Island, which involved 40 − 50 Mm3. The Bayesian inversion and granular flow model provide good estimates for volume, release geometry and effective friction coefficient. This study thus underlines the value of broad-band seismic records as observations to monitor landslides and validation for their numerical flow models..",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rapid shallow landslides are a significant hillslope erosion mechanism and limited understanding of their initiation and development results in persistent risk to infrastructure. Here, we analyse the slope above the strategic A83 Rest and be Thankful road in the west of Scotland. An inventory of 70 landslides (2003–2020) shows three types of shallow landslide, debris flows, creep deformation, and debris falls. Debris flows dominate and account for 5,350 m3 (98%) of shallow-landslide source volume across the site. We use novel time-lapse vector tracking to detect and quantify slope instabilities, whilst seismometers demonstrate the potential for live detection and location of debris flows. Using on-slope rainfall data, we show that shallow-landslides are typically triggered by abrupt changes in the rainfall trend, characterised by high-intensity, long duration rainstorms, sometimes part of larger seasonal rainfall changes. We derive empirical antecedent precipitation (>62 mm) and intensity-duration (>10 h) thresholds over which shallow-landslides occur. Analysis shows the new thresholds are more effective at raising hazard alerts than the current management plan. The low-cost sensors provide vital notification of increasing hazard, the initiation of movement, and final failure. This approach offers considerable advances to support operational decision-making for infrastructure threatened by complex slope hazards.",

The research analyzes a slope in Scotland, creating a landslide inventory and classifying different types of slope failures. Time-lapse vector tracking and seismometers were used to detect slope instabilities and debris flows. The study suggests that rainfall data can be used to derive thresholds for shallow-landslide occurrence, potentially improving hazard alerts.",

    "abstract": "\n A rockfall (RF) is a ubiquitous geohazard that is difficult to monitor or predict and poses a significant risk for people and transportation in several hilly and mountainous environments. The seismic signal generated by RF carries abundant physical and mechanical information. Thus, signals can be used by researchers to reconstruct the event location, onset time, volume and trajectory, and develop an efficient early warning system. Therefore, the precise automatic detection and classification of RF events are important objectives for scientists, especially in seismic monitoring arrays. An algorithm called DESTRO (DEtection and STorage of ROckfalls) aimed at combining seismic event automatic detection and classification was implemented ad hoc within the MATLAB environment. In event detection, the STA/LTA (short-time-average through long-time-average) method combined with other parameters, such as the minimum duration of an RF and the minimum interval time between two continuous seismic events is used. Furthermore, nine significant features based on the frequency, amplitude, seismic waveform, duration and multiple station attributes are newly proposed to classify seismic events in a RF environment. In particular, a three-step classification method is proposed for the discrimination of five different source types: RFs, earthquakes (EQs), tremors, multispike events (MSs) and subordinate MS events. Each component (vertical, east–west and north–south) at each station within the monitoring network is analysed, and a three-step classification is performed. At a given time, the event series detected from each component are integrated and reclassified component by component and station by station into a final event-type series as an output result. By this algorithm, a case study of the seven-month-long seismic monitoring of a former quarry in Central Italy was investigated by means of four triaxial velocimeters with continuous acquisition at a sampling rate of 200 Hz. During this monitoring period, a human-induced RF simulation was performed, releasing 95 blocks (in which 90 blocks validated) of different sizes from the benches of the quarry. Consequently, 64.9 per cent of EQs within 100 km were confirmed in a one-month monitoring period, 88 blocks in the RF simulation were classified correctly as RF events and 2 blocks were classified as MSs given their small energy. Finally, an ad hoc section of the algorithm was designed specifically for RF classification combined with EQ recognition. The algorithm could be applied in slope seismic monitoring to monitor the dynamic states of rock masses, as well as in slope instability forecasting and risk evaluation in EQ-prone areas.",
    "summary": "This study addresses the problem of detecting and classifying rockfall events using microseismic monitoring networks. The researchers developed an algorithm called DESTRO, implemented in MATLAB, for automatic seismic event detection and classification. The algorithm uses STA/LTA methods and considers various parameters related to frequency, amplitude, and waveform. The proposed three-step classification method was tested on a seven-month case study in a Central Italy quarry, showing promising results in identifying rockfalls and distinguishing them from other seismic events.",

    "abstract": "Geophysical granular flows exert basal forces that generate seismic signals, which can be used to better monitor and model these severe natural hazards. A number of empirical relations and existing models link these signals' high‐frequency components to a variety of flow properties, many of which are inaccessible by other analyses. However, the range of validity of the empirical relations remains unclear and the models lack validation, owing to the difficulty of adequately controlling and instrumenting field‐scale flows. Here, we present laboratory experiments investigating the normal forces exerted on a basal plate by dense and partially dense flows of spherical glass particles. We measured the power spectra of these forces and inferred predictions for these power spectra from the models for debris flows' seismic signals proposed by Kean et al. (2015, https://doi.org/10.1002/2015GL064811), Lai et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL077683), and Farin, Tsai, et al. (2019, https://doi.org/10.1002/esp.4677), using Hertz theory to extend Farin, Tsai, et al. (2019)'s models to higher frequencies. Comparison of our observations to these predictions, and to predictions derived from Bachelet (2018) and Bachelet et al. (2021)'s model for granular flows' seismic signals, shows those of Farin, Tsai, et al. (2019)'s “thin‐flow” model to be the most accurate, so we examine explanations for this accuracy and discuss its implications for geophysical flows' seismic signals. We also consider the normalization, by the mean force exerted by each flow, of the force's mean squared fluctuations, showing that this ratio varies by 4 orders of magnitude over our experiments, but is determined by the bulk inertial number of the flow.",

    "abstract": "\n At near-grounded glacier termini, calving can lead to the capsize of kilometre-scale (i.e. gigatons) unstable icebergs. The transient contact force applied by the capsizing iceberg on the glacier front generates seismic waves that propagate over teleseismic distances. The inversion of this seismic signal is of great interest to get insight into actual and past capsize dynamics. However, the iceberg size, which is of interest for geophysical and climatic studies, cannot be recovered from the seismic amplitude alone. This is because the capsize is a complex process involving interactions between the iceberg, the glacier and the surrounding water. This paper presents a first step towards the construction of a complete model, and is focused on the capsize in the open ocean without glacier front nor ice-mélange. The capsize dynamics of an iceberg in the open ocean is captured by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which allows assessing the complexity of the fluid motion around a capsizing iceberg and how far the ocean is affected by iceberg rotation. Expressing the results in terms of appropriate dimensionless variables, we show that laboratory scale and field scale capsizes can be directly compared. The capsize dynamics is found to be highly sensitive to the iceberg aspect ratio and to the water and ice densities. However, dealing at the same time with the fluid dynamics and the contact between the iceberg and the deformable glacier front requires highly complex coupling that often goes beyond actual capabilities of fluid-structure interaction softwares. Therefore, we developed a semi-analytical simplified fluid-structure model (SAFIM) that can be implemented in solid mechanics computations dealing with contact dynamics of deformable solids. This model accounts for hydrodynamic forces through calibrated drag and added-mass effects, and is calibrated against the reference CFD simulations. We show that SAFIM significantly improves the accuracy of the iceberg motion compared with existing simplified models. Various types of drag forces are discussed. The one that provides the best results is an integrated pressure-drag proportional to the square of the normal local velocity at the iceberg’s surface, with the drag coefficient depending linearly on the iceberg’s aspect ratio. A new formulation based on simplified added-masses or computed added-mass proposed in the literature, is also discussed. We study in particular the change of hydrodynamic-induced forces and moments acting on the capsizing iceberg. The error of the simulated horizontal force ranges between 5 and 25 per cent for different aspect ratios. The added-masses affect the initiation period of the capsize, the duration of the whole capsize being better simulated when added-masses are accounted for. The drag force mainly affects the amplitude of the fluid forces and this amplitude is best predicted without added-masses.",

Computational fluid dynamics simulations are used to model iceberg capsize in open ocean conditions. The study finds that capsize dynamics are sensitive to iceberg aspect ratio and water/ice densities.

    "abstract": "Two catastrophic landslides occurred in quick succession on 13 and 16 May 2019, from the north face of Joffre Peak, Cerise Creek, southern Coast Mountains, British Columbia. With headscarps at 2560 m and 2690 m elevation, both began as rock avalanches, rapidly transforming into debris flows along middle Cerise Creek, and finally into debris floods affecting the fan. Beyond the fan margin, a flood surge on Cayoosh Creek reached bankfull and attenuated rapidly downstream; only fine sediment reached Duffey Lake. The toe of the main debris flow deposit reached 4 km from the headscarp, with a travel angle of 0.28, while the debris flood phase reached the fan margin 5.9 km downstream, with a travel angle of 0.22. Photogrammetry indicates the source volume of each event is 2–3 Mm 3 , with combined volume of 5 Mm 3 . Lidar differencing, used to assess deposit volume, yielded a similar total result, although error in the depth estimate introduced large volume error masking the expected increase due to dilation and entrainment. The average velocity of the rock avalanche-debris flow phases, from seismic analysis, was ~ 25–30 m/s, and the velocity of the 16 May debris flood on the upper fan, from super-elevation and boulder sizes, was 5–10 m/s. The volume of debris deposited on the fan was ~ 10 4  m 3 , 2 orders of magnitude less than the avalanche/debris flow phases. Progressive glacier retreat and permafrost degradation were likely the conditioning factors; precursor rockfall activity was noted at least ~6 months previous; thus, the mountain was primed to fail. The 13 May landslide was apparently triggered by rapid snowmelt, with debuttressing triggering the 16 May event.",
    "summary": "This study examines two landslides that occurred on Joffre Peak in British Columbia during May 2019. The landslides began as rock avalanches and transformed into debris flows and floods as they moved downslope. Researchers used photogrammetry and lidar differencing to estimate the volume of the landslides and seismic analysis to estimate their velocity. The study suggests that glacier retreat and permafrost degradation likely contributed to the landslides, with rapid snowmelt potentially triggering the initial event.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Surficial mass wasting events are a hazard worldwide. Seismic and acoustic signals from these often remote processes, combined with other geophysical observations, can provide key information for monitoring and rapid response efforts and enhance our understanding of event dynamics. Here, we present seismoacoustic data and analyses for two very large ice–rock avalanches occurring on Iliamna Volcano, Alaska (USA), on 22 May 2016 and 21 June 2019. Iliamna is a glacier-mantled stratovolcano located in the Cook Inlet, ∼200 km from Anchorage, Alaska. The volcano experiences massive, quasi-annual slope failures due to glacial instabilities and hydrothermal alteration of volcanic rocks near its summit. The May 2016 and June 2019 avalanches were particularly large and generated energetic seismic and infrasound signals which were recorded at numerous stations at ranges from ∼9 to over 600 km. Both avalanches initiated in the same location near the head of Iliamna's east-facing Red Glacier, and their ∼8 km long runout shapes are nearly identical. This repeatability – which is rare for large and rapid mass movements – provides an excellent opportunity for comparison and validation of seismoacoustic source characteristics. For both events, we invert long-period (15–80 s) seismic signals to obtain a force-time representation of the source. We model the avalanche as a sliding block which exerts a spatially static point force on the Earth. We use this force-time function to derive constraints on avalanche acceleration, velocity, and directionality, which are compatible with satellite imagery and observed terrain features. Our inversion results suggest that the avalanches reached speeds exceeding 70 m s−1, consistent with numerical modeling from previous Iliamna studies. We lack sufficient local infrasound data to test an acoustic source model for these processes. However, the acoustic data suggest that infrasound from these avalanches is produced after the mass movement regime transitions from cohesive block-type failure to granular and turbulent flow – little to no infrasound is generated by the initial failure. At Iliamna, synthesis of advanced numerical flow models and more detailed ground observations combined with increased geophysical station coverage could yield significant gains in our understanding of these events.\n",
    "summary": "This study examines mass wasting events, a global hazard, through seismoacoustic data analysis. Specifically, the research focuses on two large ice-rock avalanches that occurred on Alaska's Iliamna Volcano in 2016 and 2019. The authors inverted seismic signals to model the avalanches as sliding blocks and derive constraints on their dynamics. The derived avalanche speeds were consistent with previous numerical modeling, while acoustic data suggest infrasound production followed the initial failure.",

    "abstract": "\n A network of seismometers has been installed on the Gugla rock glacier since October 2015 to estimate seismic velocity changes and detect microseismicity. These two processes are related to mechanical and structural variations occurring within the rock glacier. Seismic monitoring thus allows a better understanding of the dynamics of rock glaciers throughout the year. We observed seasonal variations in seismic wave velocity and microseismic activity over the 3 yr of the study. In the first part of our analysis, we used ambient noise correlations to compute daily changes of surface wave velocity. In winter, seismic wave velocities were higher, probably due to refreezing of the permafrost active layer and cooling of the uppermost permafrost layers, leading to increased overall rigidity of the medium. This assumption was verified using a seismic model of wave propagation that estimates the depth of P- and S-wave velocity changes from 0 down to 10 m. During melting periods, both a sudden velocity decrease and a decorrelation of the seismic responses were observed. These effects can probably be explained by the increased water content of the active layer. In the second part of our study, we focused on detecting microseismic signals generated in and around the rock glacier. This seismic activity (microquakes and rockfalls) also exhibits seasonal variations, with a maximum in spring and summer, which correlates principally with an exacerbated post-winter erosional phase of the front and a faster rock glacier displacement rate. In addition, we observed short bursts of microseismicity, both during snowfall and during rapid melting periods, probably due to pore pressure increase.",

The combined approach demonstrates the potential of passive seismic monitoring for tracking the mechanical state and activity of rock glaciers in permafrost environments.",

    "abstract": "Seismic waves generated by rockfalls contain valuable information on the properties of these events. However, as rockfalls mainly occur in mountainous regions, the generated seismic waves can be affected by strong surface topography variations. We present a methodology for investigating the influence of topography using a Spectral‐Element‐based simulation of 3‐D wave propagation in various geological media. This methodology is applied here to Dolomieu crater on the Piton de la Fournaise volcano, Reunion Island, but it can be used for other sites, taking into account local topography and medium properties. The complexity of wave fields generated by single‐point forces is analyzed for different velocity models and topographies. Ground‐motion amplification is studied relative to flat reference models, showing that Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) and total kinetic energy can be amplified by factors of up to 10 and 20, respectively. Simulations with Dolomieu‐like crater shapes suggest that curvature variations are more influential than depth variations. Topographic effects on seismic signals from rockfalls at Dolomieu crater are revealed by interstation spectral ratios. Results suggest that propagation along the topography rather than source direction dominates the spectral ratios and that resulting radiation patterns can be neglected. The seismic signature of single rockfall impacts is studied. Using Hertz contact theory, impact force and duration are estimated and then used to scale simulations, achieving order‐of‐magnitude agreement with observed signal amplitudes and frequency thresholds. Our study shows that combining Hertz theory with high‐frequency seismic wave simulations on real topography improves the quantitative analysis of rockfall seismic signals.",

    "abstract": "Passive acoustic monitoring has revolutionized the characterization of industrial processes and the acoustic wavefield in various environments. However, cryospheric acoustic phenomena remain largely unknown, especially at medium and small scales. Furthermore, the englacial drainage system is poorly documented, even though it is fundamental for understanding water routing through the glacier body. Here I present the first‐of‐its‐kind in situ records of periodic or sustained acoustic signals generated by water drainage through crevasses at the calving front of a glacier, in this case a Greenlandic tidewater glacier. The generative mechanisms of gurgling and bubbling noise are explained as flow‐induced sounds that are excited by intermittent air‐water two‐phase flow and Helmholtz resonance, respectively. This paper demonstrates that there is the tremendous potential to study near‐surface glacier systems using acoustic methods and detect different flow patterns in englacial conduits from their acoustic signatures, both of which can significantly advance our understanding of glaciological processes.",
    "summary": "This study investigates the use of acoustic monitoring in cryospheric environments. Specifically, the research focuses on acoustic signals produced by water drainage in a Greenlandic glacier. The authors propose that gurgling and bubbling noises are linked to two-phase flow and Helmholtz resonance.

    "abstract": "Many large calving events at Greenland's marine‐terminating glaciers generate globally detectable glacial earthquakes. We perform a cross‐correlation analysis using regional seismic data to identify events below the teleseismic detection threshold, focusing on the 24 hr surrounding known glacial earthquakes at Greenland's three largest glaciers. We detect additional seismic events in the minutes prior to more than half of the glacial earthquakes we study and following one third of them. Waveform modeling shows source mechanisms like those of previously known glacial earthquakes, a result consistent with available imagery. The seismic events thus do not represent a failure of the high subaerial ice cliff like that expected to trigger large‐scale calving and a marine ice‐cliff instability but, rather, rotational, buoyancy‐driven calving events, likely of the full glacier thickness. A limited investigation of the prevalence of smaller seismic events at times outside glacial‐earthquake windows identifies several additional events. However, we find that calving at the three glaciers we study—Jakobshavn Isbræ, Helheim Glacier, and Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier—often occurs as sequences of discrete buoyancy‐driven events in which multiple icebergs ranging in size over as much as three orders of magnitude are all lost within ∼30 min. We demonstrate a correlation between glacial‐earthquake magnitude and iceberg size for events with well‐constrained iceberg‐area estimates. Our results suggest that at least 10–30% more dynamic mass loss occurs through buoyancy‐driven calving at Greenland's glaciers than previously appreciated.",
    "summary": "This study investigates glacial earthquakes at Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers. Researchers used cross-correlation analysis of regional seismic data to identify events surrounding known glacial earthquakes. They detected additional seismic events before and after many of the studied earthquakes. Waveform modeling and imagery suggest these events are buoyancy-driven calving events, not failures of high ice cliffs. These findings indicate that dynamic mass loss through buoyancy-driven calving may be underestimated.",

    "abstract": "On 7 April 2016, the Nansen Ice Shelf (NIS) front calved into two icebergs, the first large-scale calving event in >30 years. Three hydrophone moorings were deployed seaward of the NIS in December 2015 and over the following months recorded hundreds of short duration, broadband (10-400 Hz) cryogenic signals, likely caused by fracturing of the ice shelf. The majority of these icequakes occurred between January and early March 2016, several weeks prior to the calving observed by satellite on 7 April. Barometric pressure and wind speed records show the day the icebergs drifted from the NIS coincided with the largest low-pressure storm system recorded in the previous 7 months. A nearby seismic station also shows an increase in low-frequency energy, harmonic tremor, and microseisms on 7 April. Our interpretation is the northern segment of the NIS leading edge broke free during mid-January to February, producing high acoustic energy, but the icebergs remained stationary until a strong low-pressure system with high winds freed the icebergs. As the unpinning of Antarctic ice shelves is not a well-documented process, our observations show that storm systems may play an under-appreciated role in Antarctic ice shelf break-up.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Since the 2000s, Greenland ice sheet mass loss has been accelerating, followed by increasing numbers of glacial earthquakes (GEs) at near-grounded glaciers. GEs are caused by calving of km-scale icebergs which capsize against the terminus. Seismic record inversion allows a reconstruction of the history of GE sources which captures capsize dynamics through iceberg-to-terminus contact. When compared with a catalog of contact forces from an iceberg capsize model, seismic force history accurately computes calving volumes while the earthquake magnitude fails to uniquely characterize iceberg size, giving errors up to 1 km3. Calving determined from GEs recorded ateight glaciers in 1993–2013 accounts for up to 21% of the associated discharge and 6% of the Greenland mass loss. The proportion of discharge attributed to capsizing calving may be underestimated by at least 10% as numerous events could not be identified by standard seismic detections (Olsen and Nettles, 2018). While calving production tends to stabilize in East Greenland, Western glaciers have released more and larger icebergs since 2010 and have become major contributors to Greenland dynamic discharge. Production of GEs and calving behavior are controlled by glacier geometry with bigger icebergs being produced when the terminus advances in deepening water. We illustrate how GEs can help in partitioning and monitoring Greenland mass loss and characterizing capsize dynamics.",

In this study, Ambient Noise Interferometry was used as a monitoring approach on a man-made reduced-scale vertical slope and on a natural-scale landslide in Sobradinho (Brazil), under the influence of mechanical stress and rainfall, respectively. For both experiments, we adopted similar data acquisition system and processing workflow. After preprocessing of ambient seismic noise, the time-lapse changes were determined in terms of relative velocity changes using the moving window cross spectral technique. For the vertical slope, terrestrial laser scanning was also performed to detect crack or fissure generation. The prototype experiment results showed a decreasing trend of relative velocity changes and reached a minimum value of -0.6% at the end of the experiment. No change was detected on the digital elevation model that was computed from terrestrial laser scanning images, due to the absence of centimeter scale superficial fissures. At natural scale (Sobradinho landslide), no significant variation in relative velocity changes was detected for the rainy and non-rainy days, mainly because of the inadequate change in the degree of saturation, which was found within a relatively short period of data acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Deducing relations between the dynamic characteristics of landslides and rockfalls and the resultant high‐frequency (>1 Hz) seismic signal is challenging. To investigate relations that can be tested in the field, we conducted laboratory experiments of 3‐D granular column collapse on a rough inclined thin plate, for a large set of column masses, aspect ratios, particle diameters, and slope angles. The dynamics of the granular flows were recorded using a high‐speed camera, and the generated seismic signal was measured using piezoelectric accelerometers. Empirical scaling laws are established between the characteristics of the granular flows and deposits and that of the generated seismic signals. The radiated seismic energy scales with particle diameter as d3, column mass as M and aspect ratio as a1.1. The increase of the radiated seismic energy as slope angle increases correlates with a similar increase in particle agitation. Based on our experimental results, we revisit scaling laws reported in the field and discuss their possible physical origin. The discrepancy between field and experimental observations can be explained by the complex influence of the substrate on seismic signal and the difference of flow initiation in both cases. However, our empirical scaling laws allow us to determine which flow parameters could be inferred from a given seismic characteristic in the field. In particular, by assuming the flow average speed is known, we show that we can retrieve parameters d, M, and a within a factor of two from the seismic signal.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed 21 rockfalls that occurred in limestone cliffs of the Chartreuse Massif (French Alps). These rockfalls were detected both by Terrestrial Laser Scanning or photogrammetry and by a local seismological network. The combination of these methods allowed us to study relations between rockfall properties (location of detachment and impacts areas, volume, geometry, and propagation) and the induced seismic signal. We observed events with different propagation modes (sliding, mass flow, and free fall) that could be determined from digital elevation models. We focused on events that experienced a free fall after their detachment. We analyzed the first parts of the seismic signals corresponding to the detachment phase and to the first impact. The detachment phase has a smaller amplitude than the impact phase, and its amplitude and duration increases with rockfall volume. By measuring the time delay between the detachment phase and the first impact, we can estimate the free‐fall height. We found a relation Es = aEpb between the potential energy of a rockfall Ep and the seismic energy Es generated during an impact, with a = 10−8 and b = 1.55 and with a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.98. We can thus estimate both the potential energy of a block and its free‐fall height from the seismic signals. By combining these results, we obtain an accurate estimate of the rockfall volume. The relation between the Ep and Es was tested on different geological settings and for larger range of volumes using Yosemite, Mount Granier rockfalls, and with a data set of controlled releases of blocks (Hibert et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf‐5‐283‐2017, https://www.earth‐surf‐dynam.net/5/283/2017/).",

From the analysis of the seismic energy produced by the interaction of solid particles with channel boundaries, we show that (i) the peak amplitudes are representative of the kinetic energy of each surge and (ii) most energy transfer occurs during the passage of the surge fronts.

The short time average over long time average ratio of the seismic signal is used to early detect the debris flow occurrence in a continuous stream of seismic data. The algorithm recognizes moving, long‐lasting sources of ground vibration (i.e., debris flows) and filters out different seismic sources (i.e., anthropic noise, earthquakes, and rockfalls). The alarm is triggered when the short time average/long time average threshold is exceeded on two geophones, progressively with time from upstream to downstream. The algorithm is employed in the early warning system installed for research purposes at Gadria. Complementary data (rainfalls, flow stage measurements, and video recordings) permitted a detailed event characterization and alarm validation. During three monitoring seasons, all debris flows were successfully detected, with the alarm lasting for their entire duration, and no false positives were produced.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. While flowing downhill, a snow avalanche radiates seismic waves in the ground and infrasonic waves in the atmosphere. Seismic energy is radiated by the dense basal layer flowing above the ground, while infrasound energy is likely radiated by the powder front. However, the mutual energy partitioning is not fully understood. We present infrasonic and seismic array data of a powder snow avalanche, which was released on 5 February 2016, in the Dischma valley above Davos, Switzerland. A five-element infrasound array, sensitive above 0.1 Hz, and a seven-element seismic array, sensitive above 4.5 Hz, were deployed at a short distance (<500 m) from each other and close (<1500 m) to the avalanche path. The avalanche dynamics were modelled by using RAMMS (rapid mass movement simulation) and characterized in terms of front velocity and flow height. The use of arrays rather than single sensors allowed us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and to identify the event in terms of back-azimuth angle and apparent velocity of the recorded wave fields. Wave parameters, derived from array processing, were used to identify the avalanche path and highlight the areas, along the path, where seismic and infrasound energy radiation occurred. The analysis showed that seismic energy is radiated all along the avalanche path, from the initiation to the deposition area, while infrasound is radiated only from a limited sector, where the flow is accelerated and the powder cloud develops. The recorded seismic signal is characterized by scattered back-azimuth angle, suggesting that seismic energy is likely radiated by multiple sources acting at once. On the contrary, the infrasound signal is characterized by a clear variation of back-azimuth angle and apparent velocity. This indicates that infrasound energy radiation is dominated by a moving point source, likely consistent with the powder cloud. Thanks to such clear wave parameters, infrasound is revealed to be particularly efficient for avalanche detection and path identification. While the infrasound apparent velocity decreases as the flow moves downhill, the seismic apparent velocity is quite scattered but decreases to sound velocity during the phase of maximum infrasound radiation. This indicates an efficient process of infrasound to seismic energy transition, which, in our case, increases the recorded seismic amplitude by ∼20 %, at least in our frequency band of analysis. Such an effect can be accounted for when the avalanche magnitude is estimated from seismic amplitude. Presented results clearly indicate how the process of seismo-acoustic energy radiation by a powder avalanche is very complex and likely controlled by the powder cloud formation and dynamics, and the process is hence affected by the path geometry and snow characteristics.\n",

    "abstract": "\n Green’s functions provide an efficient way to model surface-wave propagation and estimate physical quantities for near-surface processes. Several surface-wave Green’s function approximations (far-field, no mode conversions and no higher mode surface waves) have been employed for numerous applications such as estimating sediment flux in rivers, determining the properties of landslides, identifying the seismic signature of debris flows or to study seismic noise through cross-correlations. Based on those approximations, simple empirical scalings exist to derive phase velocities and amplitudes for pure power-law velocity structures providing an exact relationship between the velocity model and the Green’s functions. However, no quantitative estimates of the accuracy of these simple scalings have been reported for impulsive sources in complex velocity structures. In this paper, we address this gap by comparing the theoretical predictions to high-order numerical solutions for the vertical component of the wavefield. The Green’s functions computation shows that attenuation-induced dispersion of phase and group velocity plays an important role and should be carefully taken into account to correctly describe how surface-wave amplitudes decay with distance. The comparisons confirm the general reliability of the semi-analytic model for power-law and realistic shear velocity structures to describe fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves in terms of characteristic frequencies, amplitudes and envelopes. At short distances from the source, and for large near-surface velocity gradients or high Q values, the low-frequency energy can be dominated by higher mode surface waves that can be captured by introducing additional higher mode Rayleigh-wave power-law scalings. We also find that the energy spectral density for realistic shear-velocity models close to piecewise power-law models can be accurately modelled using the same non-dimensional scalings. The frequency range of validity of each power-law scaling can be derived from the corresponding phase velocities. Finally, highly discontinuous near-surface velocity profiles can also be approximated by a combination of power-law scalings. Analytical Green’s functions derived from the non-dimensionalization provide a good estimate of the amplitude and variations of the energy distribution, although the predictions are quite poor around the frequency bounds of each power-law scaling.",

    "abstract": "A catastrophic landslide struck the Xiaoba village in Fuquan, Guizhou, southwestern China at about 8:30 p.m. (Beijing Time, UTC + 8) on August 27, 2014. The landslide and induced impulse water waves destroyed two villages and killed 23 persons. By reprocessing seismic signals from a seismic network deployed in the surrounding area of the landslide, we recognized the event from low-frequency seismic signals and subsequently performed a long-period seismic waveform inversion to obtain its force–time history. The inversion results reveal that the maximum force for the landslide is 5 × 10 9  N, and the duration of the landslide is 38.4 s. The landslide reached its maximum velocity of 12.4 m/s at 13.2 s after its initiation, and the mass center plugged into the quarry at 24.2 s. Based on the inversion results, we estimated basal friction of the landslide. We found the friction coefficient rapidly reduces to a relatively steady-state value of ~ 0.4 at a steady-state distance of 35 m and subsequently reduces in a near-linear manner that satisfies the empirical formula $$ \\mu = - 1.4d + 0.44 $$ μ = - 1.4 d + 0.44 , where $$ d $$ d is sliding distance in km. The reduction in friction revealed by the formula is compatible with the finding of previous studies for landslides of similar volume in landslide acceleration stage. However, our result does not make it possible for the friction coefficient to increase again in landslide deceleration stage that a velocity-dependent friction law would allow. The friction variation patterns can be used to constrain input parameters in numerical landslide simulation, which can predicate runout distance and deposit areas for massive landslides to carry out landslide hazard assessment.",

    "abstract": "Seismological observations offer valuable insights on the stress–strain states, the physical mechanisms and the possible precursory signs of activation of various Earth surface processes (i.e. volcanoes, glaciers and landslides). Comprehensive catalogues of the endogenous land-slide seismicity, that is corresponding to seismic sources generated by the unstable slope from either mechanical or hydrological origins, should include the typology and an estimate of the source parameters (location, magnitude) of the event. These advanced catalogues constitute a strong basis to better describe the slope deformation and its time evolution and better understand the controlling factors. Because the number of seismic events in landslide cat-alogues is generally large, automatic approaches must be considered for deﬁning both the typology and the location of the sources. We propose here a new location approach called Automatic Picking Optimization and Location method—APOLoc for locating landslide endogenous seismic sources from seismological arrays located at close distance. The approach is based on the automatic picking of the P waves arrivals by optimizing the intertrace correlations. The method is tested on calibration shots realized at the Super-Sauze landslide (Southeast French Alps) and compared to other location approaches. By using a realistic velocity model obtained from a seismic tomography campaign, APOLoc reduces the epicentre errors to 23 m (on average) compared to ca . 40 m for the other approaches. APOLoc is then applied for documenting the endogenous seismicity (i.e. slopequakes and rockfalls) at the landslide.",

However, rapid fracture growth may also lead to sudden and potentially hazardous structural failure of unstable glaciers and ice dams, rifting of ice shelves, or iceberg calving. Here, we use passive seismic recordings to investigate the englacial fracture network on Glacier de la Plaine Morte, Switzerland. Glacier dynamics and the drainage of an ice-marginal lake give rise to numerous icequakes, the majority of which generate dispersed, high-frequency Rayleigh waves. A wide distribution of events allows us to study azimuthal anisotropy between 10 and 30 Hz in order to extract englacial seismic velocities in regions of preferentially oriented crevasses. Beamforming applied to a 100-m-aperture array reveals azimuthal anisotropy of Rayleigh-wave phase velocities reaching a strength of 8% at high frequencies. In addition, we find that the fast direction of wave propagation coincides with the observed surface strike of the narrow crevasses. Forward modeling and inversion of dispersion curves suggest that the azimuthal anisotropy is induced by a 40-m-thick crevassed layer at the surface of the glacier with 8% anisotropy in shear-wave velocity.",

Cook et al. intercepted a GLOF in the Bhotekoshi and Sunkoshi river valleys in central Nepal as they were monitoring the region in the aftermath of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. They found that a massive amount of erosion occurred during the outburst flood, which suggests that GLOFs may be the primary factor in landscape evolution for these regions. Science, this issue p. 53 A very well monitored Himalayan glacial lake outburst flood shows the power of these large events to drive erosion. Himalayan rivers are frequently hit by catastrophic floods that are caused by the failure of glacial lake and landslide dams; however, the dynamics and long-term impacts of such floods remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive set of observations that capture the July 2016 glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in the Bhotekoshi/Sunkoshi River of Nepal. Seismic records of the flood provide new insights into GLOF mechanics and their ability to mobilize large boulders that otherwise prevent channel erosion. Because of this boulder mobilization, GLOF impacts far exceed those of the annual summer monsoon, and GLOFs may dominate fluvial erosion and channel-hillslope coupling many tens of kilometers downstream of glaciated areas. Long-term valley evolution in these regions may therefore be driven by GLOF frequency and magnitude, rather than by precipitation.",

    "abstract": "Distant storms, tsunamis, and earthquakes generate waves on floating ice shelves. Previous studies, however, have disagreed about whether the resulting wave-induced stresses may cause ice shelf rift propagation. Most ice shelf rifts show long periods of dormancy suggesting that they have low background stress concentrations and may therefore be susceptible to wave-induced stresses. Here I quantify wave-induced stresses on the Ross Ice Shelf Nascent Rift and the Amery Ice Shelf Loose Tooth T2 Rift using passive seismology. I then relate these stresses to a fracture mechanical model of rift propagation that accounts for rift cohesive strength due to refrozen melange, ice inertia, and spatial heterogeneity in fracture toughness due to the presence of high toughness suture zones. I infer wave-induced stresses using the wave impedance tensor, a rank three tensor that relates seismically observable particle velocities to components of the stress tensor. I find that wave-induced stresses are an order of magnitude larger on the Ross Ice Shelf as compared to the Amery Ice Shelf. In the absence of additional rift strength, my model predicts that the Nascent Rift should have experienced extensive rift propagation. The observation that no such propagation occurred during this time therefore suggests that the Nascent Rift experiences strengthening from either refrozen melange or rift tip processes zone dynamics. This study illustrates one way in which passive seismology may illuminate glacier calving physics.",

Therefore, detection of avalanches by seismic monitoring systems is highly relevant to assess the avalanche danger level. Apart from estimating the overall activity, information on the location of individual events is also important. We deployed a seismic monitoring system consisting of seven vertical geophones at a site above Davos, Switzerland. During a major snowfall on 2017 March 9 and 10, we visually identified 19 events in the seismic data that we considered as avalanches. For all these events, we calculated the backazimuth angles as well as the apparent velocity of the incoming wavefields using two different array processing techniques: a commonly used beamforming approach and multiple signal classification (MUSIC). One of the avalanches released directly above the array and the path was well documented in a field survey. We analysed this event in more detail and compared both array processing techniques. Using the MUSIC method we were able to reproduce the avalanche path with reasonable accuracy, whereas the beam-forming method only provided a rough direction. The results obtained using MUSIC suggest that with our seismic array mainly infrasonic waves were recorded during the event. From the remaining 18 events, 15 had a clear path and were classified as avalanches. The other three events were dismissed as falsely classified avalanches. By comparing the results for these 15 avalanches events with our field survey, we were able to map 11 avalanches within a distance of 3 km of the array.",

    "abstract": "The capsizing of icebergs calved from marine‐terminating glaciers generate horizontal forces on the glacier front, producing long‐period seismic signals referred to as glacial earthquakes. These forces can be estimated by broadband seismic inversion, but their interpretation in terms of magnitude and waveform variability is not straightforward. We present a numerical model for fluid drag that can be used to study buoyancy‐driven iceberg capsize dynamics and the generated contact forces on a calving face using the finite‐element approach. We investigate the sensitivity of the force to drag effects, iceberg geometry, calving style, and initial buoyancy. We show that there is no simple relationship between force amplitude and iceberg volume, and similar force magnitudes can be reached for different iceberg sizes. The force history and spectral content varies with the iceberg attributes. The iceberg aspect ratio primarily controls the capsize dynamics, the force shape, and force frequency, whereas the iceberg height has a stronger impact on the force magnitude. Iceberg hydrostatic imbalance generates contact forces with specific frequency peaks that explain the variability in glacial earthquake dominant frequency. For similar icebergs, top‐out and bottom‐out events have significantly different capsize dynamics leading to larger top‐out forces especially for thin icebergs. For realistic iceberg dimensions, we find contact‐force magnitudes that range between 5.6 × 1011 and 2 × 1014 kg·m, consistent with seismic observations. This study provides a useful framework for interpreting glacial earthquake sources and estimating the ice mass loss from coupled analysis of seismic signals and modeling results.",

    "abstract": "We have analyzed the impact of different forcings, such as rain and seismicity, on slope instabilites on an active volcano. For this, we compiled a catalog of the locations and volumes of rockfalls in the Piton de la Fournaise crater using seismic records. We validated it by comparing the locations and volumes to those deduced from photogrammetric data. We analyzed 10,477 rockfalls, spanning the period 2014 to 2016. This period corresponds to the renewal of volcanic activity after a 41‐month rest. Our analysis reveals that renewed eruptive activity has unsettled the crater edges. External forcings such as rain and seismicity are shown to potentially increase the number and the volume of rockfalls, with a stronger impact on the volume. Preeruptive seismicity seems to be the main triggering factor for the largest volumes, with a delay of one to several days. Rain alone does not seem to trigger especially large rockfalls. We infer that repetitive vibrations from the many seismic events, combined with the action of rain, induce crack (or slip) growth in highly fractured (or granular) materials, leading to the collapse of large volumes. Regarding their spatial distribution before an eruption, the largest rockfalls seem to migrate toward the location of magma extrusion.",

Pre-eruptive seismicity appears to be a primary trigger for larger rockfalls, while rain seems to have a less direct impact.",

Catastrophic events that generate long-period seismic radiation have been studied in detail, and monitoring systems have been developed for applications on a very local scale. Here we demonstrate that similar techniques can also be applied to regional seismic networks, which show great potential for real-time and large-scale monitoring and analysis of rockslide activity. This paper studies 19 moderate-sized to large rockslides in the Eastern Alps that were recorded by regional seismic networks within distances of a few tens of kilometers to more than 200 km. We develop a simple and fully automatic processing chain that detects, locates, and classifies rockslides based on vertical-component seismic records. We show that a kurtosis-based onset picker is suitable to detect the very emergent onsets of rockslide signals and to locate the rockslides within a few kilometers from the true origin using a grid search and a 1-D seismic velocity model. Automatic discrimination between rockslides and local earthquakes is possible by a combination of characteristic parameters extracted from the seismic records, such as kurtosis or maximum-to-mean amplitude ratios. We attempt to relate the amplitude of the seismic records to the documented rockslide volume and reveal a potential power law in agreement with earlier studies. Since our approach is based on simplified methods we suggest and discuss how each step of the automatic processing could be expanded and improved to achieve more detailed results in the future.\n",

We review the studies where seismic instruments have been\ninstalled on unstable slopes and discuss the choice of the seismic\ninstruments and the network geometries. Seismic observations acquired at 13\nunstable slopes are analyzed in order to construct the proposed typology. The\nselected slopes are affected by various landslide types (slide, fall, topple\nand flow) triggered in various material (from unconsolidated soils to\nconsolidated rocks). We investigate high-frequency bands (>1 Hz) where\nmost of the seismic energy is recorded at the 1 km sensor to source\ndistances. Several signal properties (duration, spectral content and\nspectrogram shape) are used to describe the sources. We observe that similar\ngravitational processes generate similar signals at different slopes. Three\nmain classes can be differentiated mainly from the length of the signals, the\nnumber of peaks and the duration of the autocorrelation. The classes are the\n“slopequake” class, which corresponds to sources potentially occurring\nwithin the landslide body; the “rockfall” class, which corresponds to\nsignals generated by rock block impacts; and the “granular flow” class,\nwhich corresponds to signals generated by wet or dry debris/rock flows.\nSubclasses are further proposed to differentiate specific signal properties\n(frequency content, resonance, precursory signal). The signal properties of\neach class and subclass are described and several signals of the same class\nrecorded at different slopes are presented. Their potential origins are\ndiscussed. The typology aims to serve as a standard for further comparisons\nof the endogenous microseismicity recorded on landslides.\n",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Soil and debris slides are prone to rapid and dramatic\nreactivation. Deformation within the instability is accommodated by sliding,\nwhereby weak seismic energies are released through material deformation.\nThus, passive microseismic monitoring provides information that relates to\nthe slope dynamics. In this study, passive microseismic data acquired at\nSuper-Sauze (southeastern France) and Pechgraben (Upper Austria) slow-moving\nclay-rich debris slides (“clayey landslides”) are investigated.\nObservations are benchmarked against previous similar case studies to provide a\ncomprehensive and homogenized typology of microseismic signals at clayey\nlandslides. A thorough knowledge of the various microseismic signals generated\nby slope deformation is crucial for the future development of automatic\ndetection systems to be implemented in landslide early-warning systems. Detected\nsignals range from short-duration (< 2 s) quake-like signals to a\nwide variety of longer-duration tremor-like radiations (> 2 s –\nseveral min). The complexity of seismic velocity structures, the low quantity and low\nquality of available signal onsets and non-optimal seismic network geometry\nseverely impedes the source location procedure; thus, rendering source\nprocesses characterization challenging. Therefore, we constrain sources'\nlocations using the prominent waveform amplitude attenuation pattern\ncharacteristic of near-source area (< about 50 m) landslide-induced\nmicroseismic events. A local magnitude scale for clayey landslides\n(ML−LS) is empirically calibrated using calibration shots and hammer\nblow data. The derived ML−LS returns daily landslide-induced\nmicroseismicity rates that positively correlate with higher average daily\ndisplacement rates. However, high temporal and spatial resolution analyses of the\nlandslide dynamics and hydrology are required to better decipher the\npotential relations linking landslide-induced microseismic signals to\nlandslide deformation.\n",

The research aims to characterize the diverse microseismic signals associated with these landslides, ranging from short quakes to longer tremors. Source locations are estimated using waveform amplitude attenuation patterns due to challenges with traditional methods. The study calibrates a local magnitude scale, finding a correlation between microseismicity rates and displacement rates, though further high-resolution analysis is needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Seismic monitoring of mass movements can significantly help to mitigate the associated hazards; however, the link between event dynamics and the seismic signals generated is not completely understood. To better understand these relationships, we conducted controlled releases of single blocks within a soft-rock (black marls) gully of the Rioux-Bourdoux torrent (French Alps). A total of 28 blocks, with masses ranging from 76 to 472 kg, were used for the experiment. An instrumentation combining video cameras and seismometers was deployed along the travelled path. The video cameras allow reconstructing the trajectories of the blocks and estimating their velocities at the time of the different impacts with the slope. These data are compared to the recorded seismic signals. As the distance between the falling block and the seismic sensors at the time of each impact is known, we were able to determine the associated seismic signal amplitude corrected for propagation and attenuation effects. We compared the velocity, the potential energy lost, the kinetic energy and the momentum of the block at each impact to the true amplitude and the radiated seismic energy. Our results suggest that the amplitude of the seismic signal is correlated to the momentum of the block at the impact. We also found relationships between the potential energy lost, the kinetic energy and the seismic energy radiated by the impacts. Thanks to these relationships, we were able to retrieve the mass and the velocity before impact of each block directly from the seismic signal. Despite high uncertainties, the values found are close to the true values of the masses and the velocities of the blocks. These relationships allow for gaining a better understanding of the physical processes that control the source of high-frequency seismic signals generated by rockfalls.",

    "abstract": "Rockfall in deglaciated mountain valleys is perhaps the most important post-glacial geomorphic process for determining the rates and patterns of valley wall erosion. Furthermore, rockfall poses a significant hazard to inhabitants and motivates the monitoring for rockfall occurrence in populated areas. Traditional rockfall detection methods, such as aerial photography and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data evaluation provide constraints on the location and released volume of rock, but have limitations due to significant time lags or integration times between surveys, and deliver limited information on rockfall triggering mechanisms and the dynamics of individual events. Environmental seismology, the study of seismic signals emitted by processes at the Earth's surface, provides a complementary solution to these shortcomings. This approach is limited amongst others by the strength of the signals emitted by a source and their transformation and attenuation towards receivers. To test the ability of seismic methods to identify and locate small rockfalls, and to characterise their dynamics, we surveyed a 2.16 km 2 large, near vertical cliff section of the Lauterbrunnen Valley in the Swiss Alps with a TLS and six broadband seismometers. During 37 days in autumn 2014, ten TLS-detected rockfalls with volumes ranging from 0.053 p 0.004 to 2.338 p 0.085 m 3 were independently detected and located by the seismic approach, with a deviation of 81 −29 +59  m (about 7 % of the average inter-station distance of the seismometer network). Further potential rockfalls were detected outside the TLS-surveyed cliff area. The onset of individual events can be determined within a few milliseconds, and their dynamics can be resolved into distinct phases, such as detachment, free fall, intermittent impact, fragmentation, arrival at the talus slope and subsequent slope activity. The small rockfall volumes in this area require significant supervision during data processing: 2175 initially picked potential events reduced to 511 potential events after applying automatic rejection criteria. The 511 events needed to be inspected manually to reveal 19 short earthquakes and 37 potential rockfalls, including the ten TLS-detected events. Rockfalls do not show a relationship to released seismic energy or peak amplitude at this spatial scale due to the dominance of process-inherent factors, such as fall height, degree of fragmentation and distribution, and subsequent talus slope activity. The combination of TLS and environmental seismology provides a detailed validation of seismic detection of small volume rockfalls, and revealed unprecedented temporal, spatial and geometric details about rockfalls in steep mountainous terrain.",

    "abstract": "Glacier microseismicity is a promising tool to study glacier dynamics. However, physical processes connecting seismic signals and ice dynamics are not clearly understood at present. Particularly, the relationship between tide‐modulated seismicity and dynamics of calving glaciers remains elusive. Here we analyze records from an on‐ice seismometer placed 250 m from the calving front of Bowdoin Glacier, Greenland. Using high‐frequency glacier flow speed measurements, we show that the microseismic activity is related to strain rate variations. The seismic activity correlates with longitudinal stretching measured at the glacier surface. Both higher melt rates and falling tides accelerate glacier motion and increase longitudinal stretching. Long‐term microseismic monitoring could therefore provide insights on how a calving glacier's force balance and flow regime react to changes at the ice‐ocean interface.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. We carry out a combined analysis of the short- and long-period seismic signals generated by the devastating Oso-Steelhead landslide that occurred on 22 March 2014. The seismic records show that the Oso-Steelhead landslide was not a single slope failure, but a succession of multiple failures distinguished by two major collapses that occurred approximately 3 min apart. The first generated long-period surface waves that were recorded at several proximal stations. We invert these long-period signals for the forces acting at the source, and obtain estimates of the first failure runout and kinematics, as well as its mass after calibration against the mass-centre displacement estimated from remote-sensing imagery. Short-period analysis of both events suggests that the source dynamics of the second event is more complex than the first. No distinct long-period surface waves were recorded for the second failure, which prevents inversion for its source parameters. However, by comparing the seismic energy of the short-period waves generated by both events we are able to estimate the volume of the second. Our analysis suggests that the volume of the second failure is about 15–30% of the total landslide volume, giving a total volume mobilized by the two events between 7 × 106 and 10 × 106 m3, in agreement with estimates from ground observations and lidar mapping.",

We analysed near-regional-scale seismicity on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard to identify seismic icequake signals and to study their spatial–temporal distribution within the 14-year period from 2000 until 2013. This is the first study that uses seismic data recorded on permanent broadband stations to detect and locate icequakes in different regions of Spitsbergen, the main island of the archipelago. A temporary local seismic network and direct observations of glacier calving and surging were used to identify icequake sources. We observed a high number of icequakes with clear spectral peaks between 1 and 8 Hz in different parts of Spitsbergen. Spatial clusters of icequakes could be associated with individual grounded tidewater glaciers and exhibited clear seasonal variability each year with more signals observed during the melt season. Locations at the termini of glaciers, and correlation with visual calving observations in situ at Kronebreen, a glacier in the Kongsfjorden region, show that these icequakes were caused dominantly by calving. Indirect evidence for glacier surging through increased calving seismicity was found in 2003 at Tunabreen, a glacier in central Spitsbergen. Another type of icequake was observed in the area of the Nathorstbreen glacier system. Seismic events occurred upstream of the glacier within a short time period between January and May 2009 during the initial phase of a major glacier surge. This study is the first step towards the generation and implementation of an operational seismic monitoring strategy for glacier dynamics in Svalbard.",

During the 2011 typhoon season, we deployed a seismic array along the Chishan River in the mountain area of southern Taiwan, where there is strong variability in water discharge and high sedimentation rates. We observe hysteresis in the high-frequency (5–15 Hz) seismic noise level relative to the associated hydrological parameters. In addition, our seismic noise analysis reveals an asymmetry and a high coherence in noise cross-correlation functions for several station pairs during the typhoon passage, which corresponds to sediment particles and turbulent flows impacting along the riverbed where the river bends sharply. Based on spectral characteristics of the seismic records, we also detected 20 landslide/debris flow events, which we use to estimate the sediment supply. Comparison of sediment flux between seismologically determined bedload and derived suspended load indicates temporal changes in the sediment flux ratio, which imply a complex transition process from the bedload regime to the suspension regime between typhoon passage and off-typhoon periods. Our study demonstrates the possibility of seismologically monitoring river bedload transport, thus providing valuable additional information for studying fluvial bedrock erosion and mountain landscape evolution.",

Here we present the potential of hydroacoustic methods to investigate different modes of ice detachments.

    "abstract": "Abstract. Rapid mass movements (RMM) pose a substantial risk to people and infrastructure. Reliable and cost-efficient measures have to be taken to reduce this risk. One of these measures includes establishing and advancing the state of practice in the application of early warning systems (EWSs). EWSs have been developed during the past decades and are rapidly increasing. In this paper, we focus on the technical part of EWSs, i.e., the prediction and timely recognition of imminent hazards, as well as on monitoring slopes at risk and released mass movements. Recent innovations in assessing spatial precipitation, monitoring and precursors of the triggering and deformation of RMM offer new opportunities for next-generation EWSs. However, technical advancement can only be transferred into more reliable, operational EWSs with an adequate well-instructed dedicated staff. To this end, an intense dialog between scientists, engineers and those in charge of warning, as well as further experience with new comprehensive prototype systems jointly operated by scientists and practitioners, will be essential.",

This paper examines the technical aspects of early warning systems designed to mitigate these risks. The study emphasizes prediction, hazard recognition, and monitoring of at-risk slopes and mass movements. The authors suggest that progress relies on collaboration between scientists, engineers, and those responsible for issuing warnings, along with practical experience using comprehensive prototype systems.",

Through real-time detection and inverse modeling of teleseismic data we show that landslide dynamics are primarily determined by the length scale of the source mass. When combined with geometric constraints from satellite imagery, the seismically determined landslide force histories yield estimates of landslide duration, momenta, potential energy loss, mass, and runout trajectory. Measurements of these dynamical properties for 29 teleseismogenic landslides are consistent with a simple acceleration model in which height drop and rupture depth scale with the length of the failing slope.",
    "summary": "This study presents a method for real-time seismic detection and inverse modeling of catastrophic landslides. Through analysis of long-period seismic waves, the authors develop a simple scaling relationship between landslide dynamics and seismic radiation. They demonstrate that seismically derived force histories can constrain fundamental parameters such as landslide mass, velocity, and runout distance. The approach is validated against well-documented events and reveals universal scaling behavior across catastrophic landslides spanning several orders of magnitude in volume.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. A large rock avalanche occurred at 03:27:30 PDT, 6 August 2010, in the Mount Meager Volcanic Complex southwest British Columbia. The landslide initiated as a rock slide in Pleistocene rhyodacitic volcanic rock with the collapse of the secondary peak of Mount Meager. The detached rock mass impacted the volcano's weathered and saturated flanks, creating a visible seismic signature on nearby seismographs. Undrained loading of the sloping flank caused the immediate and extremely rapid evacuation of the entire flank with a strong horizontal force, as the rock slide transformed into a debris flow. The disintegrating mass travelled down Capricorn Creek at an average velocity of 64 m s−1, exhibiting dramatic super-elevation in bends to the intersection of Meager Creek, 7.8 km from the source. At Meager Creek the debris impacted the south side of Meager valley, causing a runup of 270 m above the valley floor and the deflection of the landslide debris both upstream (for 3.7 km) and downstream into the Lillooet River valley (for 4.9 km), where it blocked the Lillooet River river for a couple of hours, approximately 10 km from the landslide source. Deposition at the Capricorn–Meager confluence also dammed Meager Creek for about 19 h creating a lake 1.5 km long. The overtopping of the dam and the predicted outburst flood was the basis for a night time evacuation of 1500 residents in the town of Pemberton, 65 km downstream. High-resolution GeoEye satellite imagery obtained on 16 October 2010 was used to create a post-event digital elevation model. Comparing pre- and post-event topography we estimate the volume of the initial displaced mass from the flank of Mount Meager to be 48.5 × 106 m3, the height of the path (H) to be 2183 m and the total length of the path (L) to be 12.7 km. This yields H/L = 0.172 and a fahrboschung (travel angle) of 9.75°. The movement was recorded on seismographs in British Columbia and Washington State with the initial impact, the debris flow travelling through bends in Capricorn Creek, and the impact with Meager Creek are all evident on a number of seismograms. The landslide had a seismic trace equivalent to a M = 2.6 earthquake. Velocities and dynamics of the movement were simulated using DAN-W. The 2010 event is the third major landslide in the Capricorn Creek watershed since 1998 and the fifth large-scale mass flow in the Meager Creek watershed since 1930. No lives were lost in the event, but despite its relatively remote location direct costs of the 2010 landslide are estimated to be in the order of $10 M CAD.",
    "summary": "This study investigates a significant rock slide-debris flow event that occurred at Mount Meager in British Columbia on August 6, 2010. The event began as a rock slide and transformed into a debris flow, traveling a considerable distance and impacting nearby valleys. Researchers used satellite imagery and seismic data to analyze the event's characteristics, volume, and dynamics. The analysis offers insights into hazard and risk assessment for similar events in the region.",

    "summary": "This study develops the centroid single force inversion method for analyzing seismic waves generated by landslides. The author extends moment tensor inversion techniques to model the forces exerted by gravitational mass movements on the Earth's surface. The methodology enables estimation of landslide force history, trajectory, and dynamics from long-period seismic recordings. This foundational work establishes a key analytical framework for seismological studies of landslides and other surface mass movements.",

    "summary": "This study examines the source mechanism of the magnitude 7.2 Grand Banks earthquake of November 1929, debating whether the event represents a double couple tectonic earthquake or a submarine landslide. The authors analyze seismic waveform data to constrain the source process, contributing to the ongoing discussion about the relationship between large submarine mass movements and seismic wave generation. This work is foundational for understanding tsunami-generating submarine landslide events.",

    "abstract": "Long-period seismic waves excited by the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens are analyzed. The eruption generated distinctive long-period seismic radiation that can be modeled as a nearly vertical single force or a terrestrial monopole source. This analysis provides fundamental insights into the seismic source mechanism of explosive volcanic eruptions and their coupling to the solid Earth.",
    "summary": "This study analyzes long-period seismic waves generated by the catastrophic May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The authors examine the seismic radiation pattern and propose that the eruption source can be described as a terrestrial monopole, representing a fundamentally different source mechanism from tectonic earthquakes. The analysis demonstrates that explosive volcanic eruptions produce distinctive long-period seismic signals that provide information about eruption dynamics and the coupling between volcanic processes and the solid Earth.",
