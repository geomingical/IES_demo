**Provider**: Google DeepMind
**Context Window**: 2,000,000+ tokens
**Role in Workspace**: Deep document analysis, thematic extraction, and creative narrative synthesis.

## Capabilities utilized in this workspace:
1. **Massive Context Injection**: Capable of reading the entire `envseis_selected_papers.json` (thousands of abstracts and metadata fields) in a single prompt without chunking or external RAG retrieval.
2. **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Highly adept at finding lateral connections between Earth systems, climate science, and societal impacts.
3. **Brainstorming Engine**: Generates novel "Big Picture" ideas (e.g., interpreting mountain range vibrations as planetary breathing).
